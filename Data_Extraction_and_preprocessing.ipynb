Since Ashton first introduced this term in 1999, dealing with the \\nintroduction of RFiD sensors in supply chain management [1], the concept has been \\nevolving representing a new paradigm in which the Internet extends into the real \\nworld embracing everyday objects [2].  \\nAt the core of the IoT there are the smart objects (SOs), which are physical things \\nenhanced by electronic devices providing them with local intelligence and \\nconnectivity to the cyberspace [3]. Local intelligence means that SOs are able to \\nsense/log/interpret what\\u2019s occurring within the surrounding environment. SOs are \\nbuilding blocks for a smart environment where different kinds of SOs continuously \\nwork to make human interactions more comfortable and safer [4]. New research \\n\\n60 S. Ammirato et al. \\ndirections argue that sensing and connection is not enough: SOs should have the \\ncapability to learn, think, and understand both physical and social worlds [5]. This \\nemerging need to empower IoT with a \\u201cbrain\\u201d for a higher level of intelligence leads \\nto a new paradigm named Cognitive Internet of Things [5]. Cognition refers to the \\nability to be aware of the environment and the human interactions, be able to learn \\nfrom the past actions and use it to make future decisions that benefit the network [6]. \\nThus a cognitive information system is able to modify its behaviour on the basis of \\nexperience, data analysis and interaction of smart and not SOs. This approach \\nchallenges the way networks and systems are designed and operate with humans. \\nCurrent industrial trends and initiatives aim to \\u201cconnect the unconnected\\u201d, changing \\nthe way people and companies act every day in many key sectors, such as \\ncommunications, health care, finance, education, transportation, manufacturing and \\nagriculture [7]. An area that is becoming \\u201ca domain of major economic and social \\ninterest for the introduction of IoT\\u201d is the security domain [8]. Security of is a cutting \\nedge issue gaining growing attention in recent years. Today, millions of connected \\ndevices are used to enhance protection levels of many types of infrastructures under \\nthe IoT paradigm [9]. \\nBank Branches (BBs) represent an interesting setting where potential benefits \\nderiving from the introduction of IoT technologies can be best exploited. In fact, a BB \\ncan be seen as a worksite where humans interact among them and smart objects to \\ncarry out multiple banking activities (operational, economic and financial). The \\npresence of such characteristics enables, in principle, the shaping of a BB as a smart \\nenvironment and its devices controlled by a cognitive information system. \\nUnfortunately, the lack of sensible efforts in improving the BB protection system \\nrepresents the main hindrance to a full transformation of a BB in a smart environment \\n[10].  \\nThis paper reports results from the BaSS (Bank Security and Safety) project, \\nfunded under the EU ERFD program, which was aimed to support banking groups to \\ndesign a Cognitive Information System able to improve: \\n\\u2022 the degree of security and safety inside the branch environment \\n\\u2022 the operational performances of security management processes \\n2   Theoretical Background \\n2.1 \\nThe BB Security Context \\nBank branches are physical spaces that, traditionally, represent the contact points \\nbetween banks and their customers. Even if the growth of on-line banking is an \\nundoubtable trend, consumers being still more likely to use on-line channels for basic \\noperations continuing to rely on bank branches for more complex financial \\ntransactions [11]. Money transactions are moving from bank counter to remote \\ncontrolled platforms which are accessible via web (Internet/mobile banking) or placed \\nclose to the branch (ATMs) [12]. At the same time, the branch\\u2019s physical layout is \\nchanging. Traditional \\u201chard\\u201d security measures as visible security cameras, armour \\nwindows and metal detectors are going to be removed from customers\\u2019 sight. \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    61 \\nAlthough such measures are important to give protection to structures and people, \\nthey can generate a bad feeling of impending danger that can persuade customers to \\navoid entering in the branch or to stay within the branch the shortest possible time. It \\nis evident that the aim to reduce the sense of anxiety in customers, is in contrast with \\nthe need to guarantee protection of people and properties against criminal attacks. \\nA criminal attack can be viewed as a sequence of actions happening in an \\ninteraction space, with the aim to obtain an unfair benefit and/or damage people or \\norganizations [13]. The following table describes the categories of illegal actions (or \\nthreats) against BBs. \\nTable 1.  Threats against BBs. \\nThreat \\nDescription \\nT1: Robbery \\nstealing from a bank while bank employees and customers are subjected to \\nforce, violence, or the threat of violence, putting the victim in fear. \\nT2: Theft \\nthe illegal taking of another's property. \\nT3: Fraud \\nis the use of potentially illegal means to obtain money, assets, or other property \\nowned or held by a bank institution. \\nT4: Damage \\nintentional or unintentional harm to somebody\\u2019s property. \\n \\nFBI and EBF reports agree that criminal attacks against BBs are a problem that \\ncontinues to take a toll on financial institutions and communities across the U.S. and \\nEurope [14] [15]. Indeed, the growing number of attacks and their high rate of success \\nprove that current protection measures are still not so efficacy and overall protection \\nsystems are far from the global security concept. \\nThe occurrence of terroristic and criminal attacks at the international level, \\nemphasized the role of security and strengthened the importance to monitor and \\ncontrol critical. \\nTo improve degree of security and safety of people and goods inside a space an \\neffective protection system is required. Conrath [16] defined protection as the set of \\nmeasures that prevent or deter attackers from accessing to physical and logical \\nresources and guidelines on how to design structures to withstand hostile acts. While \\nin the past the emphasis was primarily addressed to the security of physical assets, \\ntoday, businesses and public institution of all sizes and industries perceive a growing \\nneed to protect people and intangible assets, to preserve the continuity of their \\nbusiness processes. In this sense, new approaches in designing protection systems \\nneed to combine the security needs with those of operational freedom.  \\n2.2 Smart Environment as Cyber-Physical-Social Systems  \\nSOs are able to detect and interpret what is occurring in the surrounding environment \\n(through an embedded sensor), interacting with other SOs, exchanging information \\nwith people and perform one or more actions through an actuator [17]. The \\nintegration of SOs within physical processes, by means of computation and \\nnetworking features, shapes the so-called \\u201ccyber-physical system\\u201d (CPS) [18]. A \\nCPS, which represents the technological layer of a smart environment, is able to \\n\\n62 S. Ammirato et al. \\nacquire and apply knowledge to offer context-based services to the environment [19]. \\nA CPS integrates two main aspects: \\n\\u2022 \\na cyberspace, that refers to the generalized information resources, including \\nvirtual and digital abstractions to achieve interconnections among cyber entities; \\n\\u2022 \\nand a physical space, that refers to the real world, in which physical objects are \\nrespectively perceived and controlled by sensors and actuators to establish \\ninteractions via the communication channels, remote collaboration, real-time \\nlocalization, and autonomy maintenance [20].  \\nTwo main functional elements characterize a CPS [21]: \\n\\u2022 \\nAdvanced connectivity ensuring real-time data acquisition from the physical \\nworld and information from the cyber space; \\n\\u2022 \\nintelligent data management, analytics and computational capability that \\nconstruct the cyberspace \\nBasing on the CPS paradigm, applications have been developed to assist people \\nactivities in many domains which become smart environments: transportation and \\nlogistics [21], smart buildings [22], smart health [23], etc. \\nNew approaches tend to consider human factors as an integrant part of the CPS \\ninstead of placing them outside its boundaries. In this sense, many authors proposed \\nthe concept of Cyber-Physical-Social System (CPSS) [24] [25]. CPSS extends the \\nconcept of CPS, including the so-called \\u201csocial space\\u201d domain, featuring human \\nparticipation and interaction among humans as well as human-computer interaction. \\nHence, it is possible to characterize a CPSS as comprising the following components:  \\n\\u2022 \\nSocial Space (SS): the human space containing human actors, relationships and \\nuser\\u2019s interconnected device (Internet of People \\u2013 IoP) \\n\\u2022 \\nCyberspace (CS): the software based systems and the underlying infrastructures \\nand platforms providing services to the users (Internet of Services \\u2013 IoS) \\n\\u2022 \\nPhysical Space (PS): the physical world of interconnected SOs, including \\nsensors, actuators and gateways (Internet of Object \\u2013 IoO).  \\nWhen coupled, the above-mentioned components led to the definition of the \\nfollowing subsystems characterizing a CPSS: \\n\\u2022 \\nHuman Computer Interaction (HCI): The human is not just an operator in a smart \\nenvironment, but he/she continuously interact with SOs/devices to get \\nmobiquitous services. \\n\\u2022 \\nCyber social space (CSS): virtual worlds, social networks and internet based \\nservices allowing synchronous and asynchronous relationship among humans. \\n\\u2022 \\nCyber Physical Space (CPS): integration of software based systems, platforms, \\nnetworking infrastructures and interconnected SOs and devices providing context \\nbased services. \\nAs stated in [25], CPSS appears to be an advanced version of the IoT paradigm \\nwhere social attributes are considered to address the integration of computation, \\nnetworking and physical processes aching the interfusion of the cyber\\u2013physical space \\nand social space.  \\nFrom an operational point of view, the design of a CPSS can benefit of the recent \\nadvances in mechatronics which led to a new generation of multipurpose sensors, \\nknown as indirect or synthetic sensors [26]. According this approach, single physical \\nsensor can detect different characteristics from the same signal, instead of requiring \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    63 \\nthe use of many sensors. The ultimate embodiment of this approach would be a single \\ngeneral-purpose sensor able to digitize an entire building. This kind of sensors can be \\nattached to a variety of objects, and without modification, sense many facets [27][28]. \\nSynthetic sensors overcome traditional limitations of limited sensing functionality, \\nlimited large scale interoperability and failure to provide complex interpretations of \\nimplicit assumptions [29]. \\n3 \\nMethodology \\nWith the aim \\u201cto develop technology-based solutions to important and relevant \\nbusiness problems\\u201d, the present study follows the design research paradigm proposed \\nin [30]. As stated in [31], a design science research process can be summarized on the \\nfollowing three steps: problem identification, solution design and validation. \\nThe first step was aimed to highlight characteristics and weaknesses of the \\nprotection systems currently adopted by banking groups to protect security and safety \\nof their branches. The framework methodology we have used at this step is based on a \\nmulti-methodological development approach that include a systematic literature \\nresearch and review and interviews with experts. Literature review was intended to \\ncreate a complete understanding of the BB security domain and IoT field of study. \\nMoreover, we performed semi-structured interviews with a sample of convenience of \\nsix respondents who were working for primary Italian banking groups as security \\nmanagers at the time of the study. The data gathering for the case study has been \\ncarried out in Italy during the last three months of 2016. The interviews were based \\non pre-defined open questions dealing with organizational and technological \\ncharacteristics of the current protection systems. The second step of the methodology \\nwas aimed to propose an architecture for a cognitive protection system for BBs able to \\nmanage protection through a redesign of the BBs. In particular, we introduce a logical \\nmodel of BB under a CPSS perspective and the architecture the architecture of the \\nIntelligent Protection System \\u2013 IPS, a cognitive platform designed to manage BB \\nsecurity. Third step consisted in testing activities in order to experiment it inside a BB \\ncontext. \\n4 \\nThe Italian BB Case Study \\n4.1 The BB Protection Systems \\nMeasures to protect the BB environment can be classified according to the desired \\neffect to a criminal attack: prevention and reaction. \\nPrevention measures are static measures intended to prevent/obstacle harms to \\nbank assets discouraging the potential criminals by doing the attack. Three typologies \\nbelong to this category: traditional \\u201chard\\u201d measures (structural measures such as \\narmour windows, armed guards, armour-plated doors, time lock doors); \\u201csoft\\u201d or \\npsychological measures (i.e: transparent glasses or display panels which gives \\n\\n64 S. Ammirato et al. \\ninformation about the presence of security controls, etc.), and \\u201ctechnological\\u201d \\nmeasures used to identify and enable/hinder people entering BB environment or \\ninteracting with ATMs, (e.g., secure ID generator, credit card; biometric data) [16].  \\nReaction measures require the activation (automatic or human driven) of a \\ncountermeasure further to a risky event (i.e.: sound alarm, systems for tracing money, \\nemergency calls to law-enforcement, etc.) [32]. Traditional ways to recognize suspect \\nbehaviours comes from perimetric/volumetric sensors and from two \\u201canalogic\\u201d \\nsystems that continuously monitor the environment: the armed guards and video-\\nsurveillance system. In both cases humans, directly (the armed guards) or indirectly \\n(the security guard looking at the video streaming from the control room) present on \\nthe scene are charged to pay attention to suspect behaviours of people who could \\nattack the BB.  \\nUnfortunately, interviews agreed that security measures are characterized by low \\nefficacy and by outdated and stand-alone mechanisms. Traditional \\u201chard\\u201d security \\nmeasures clash with commercial purposes of BBs. Protection measures currently \\nadopted cannot constantly monitor the environment properly: traditional camera \\nsurveillance systems are characterized by low effectiveness due to the tiredness and \\nthe alienation of operators because of the repetitive nature of the job. Moreover, \\nprotection measures are incapable of retaining, storing and communicating data about \\ntheir state in order to examine the contexts of BB. If available, contextual information \\ncould be used to support and enhance the ability to execute specific countermeasures \\nby providing information and services tailored to the security needs.  \\n4.2 Towards a New Concept of BBs as CPSSs \\nAs emerges from interviews, the growing interest of criminals in attacking BB is \\ndirectly related to the persistent use of obsolete security technologies that, moreover, \\nare a source of organizational inefficiencies, high costs and are characterized by long \\nreaction times and scarce level of effectiveness. \\nThe transformation of a BB in a smart environment can allow, in principle, to \\novercome these critical issues, improving security process performances and \\neffectiveness against criminal attacks. In the following sections we summarize main \\ncharacteristics of a CPSS specifically designed to facilitate the rise of a smart BB. In \\nthe so-called BB CPSS, protection measures, both smart and non-SOs, are capable of \\ninteracting among them and with humans through a digital network, to improve the \\nBB security and safety management. Inside the BB CPSS, the cyber domains of \\ncommunication and computing are combined with the dynamics of physical objects \\nand their interaction with human actors proper of a BB setting [19]. After, we \\nintroduce the architecture of the IPS - Intelligent Protection System \\u2013 which is the \\ncognitive protection system designed to manage a network of BB CPSSs belonging to \\na banking group in order to improve both the degree of security and safety inside the \\nbranch environment, and the operational performances of security management \\nprocesses. \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    65 \\n4.2.1 The Logical Model of a BB CPSS \\nEach BB environment is characterized by the presence of a set of context entities, \\nintended as physical or conceptual objects which interact among them [33]. \\nAccording to Ning\\u2019s view [25], it is possible to identify the subsystems which \\ncompose the BB CPSS and, for each of them, types of context entities interact inside:  \\n\\u2022 \\nSocial Space (SS): all the human actors which interact inside a BB. Four category \\nof human entities are identified: customers, employees, attackers and guards. \\n\\u2022 \\nCyberspace (CS): the local component of the IPS, that is a software based \\nsystems able to manage the security and safety operational process which happen \\ninside a BB. \\n\\u2022 \\nPhysical Space (PS): physical SOs and non SOs involved in security and safety \\nprocesses.  \\nThe following table provide a description of the main context entities of a BB \\nmodelled as a CPSS. \\nTable 2.  Main context entities of a BB modelled as a CPSS. \\nSpace Entity \\nEntity detail \\nDescription \\nSS \\nPeople \\nP1: Customer \\na person who is utilizing one or more of the services \\nprovided by the bank. \\n \\n \\nP2: Employee \\na person who works for a bank institution under a \\ncontract of employment. \\n \\n \\nP3: Attacker \\na person who is performing a criminal action to obtain \\nan unfair benefit and to damage someone or something. \\n \\n \\nP4: Guard \\noutsourced contractor monitoring for potential threats \\nto BB, on-site (e.g. armed guard) and remotely \\n(security guard inside the control room). \\nCS \\nIPS \\n \\nA web platform based on a client-server architecture \\nable to manage security and safety process within a BB \\nPS \\nBank assets BAk \\nthe set of tangible and intangible goods that are \\nthreatened by criminal attacks. \\n \\nWeapons \\n \\nany device used with intent to inflict damage or \\nthreaten people, structures, or systems \\n \\nSafety and \\nsecurity \\nsystems \\nNon SOs \\nstatic measures intended to prevent/obstacle harms to \\nbank assets discouraging the potential criminals by \\ndoing the attack (e.g. structural measures such as \\narmour windows, armed guards, armour-plated doors, \\ntime lock doors). \\n \\n \\nSOs \\nSOs that leverage on IoT features to provide security \\nand safety services. These systems require the \\nactivation \\n(automatic \\nor \\nhuman \\ndriven) \\nof \\na \\ncountermeasure further to a risky event. Such systems \\nare based on HCI or machine-to-machine interactions \\n \\nVolpentesta et al. [34] proposed that every action performed by context entities \\ninside a smart environment affects their state. Interactions between entities can be \\nsensed, interpreted and mediated through IoT based protection systems. In certain \\ncases, a subset of actions performed by humans in a BB can be recognized as \\n\\n66 S. Ammirato et al. \\nthreatening and may trigger a sequence of security service actions (e.g. a \\ncountermeasure) involving people (attackers, customers, employees) physical goods, \\nas well safety and security systems. We define \\u201csecurity patterns\\u201d the sequence of \\nactions involving context agents within a bank branch in order to detect of a threat.  \\nIn order to model security pattern, we used the following formalism. Let us \\nconsider Sk the set of all possible statuses of a Bank Asset BAk and Ak a non-empty set \\nof actions that can be performed on BAk. We assume that any action a \\u2208 Ak, performed \\nby an actor Pi-, determines a status change (from si,k to sj,k , i\\u2260j, si,k sj,k  \\u2208 Sk) of a Bank \\nAsset BAk. Each actor Pi is allowed to perform a set of activities Ak,i, where Ak,p \\u2286 Ak. \\nThe triple BAk (Sk, Ak, P(Ak)) univocally identifies the interaction graph GBAk(N(Sk), \\nE(Ak, P(Ak))), where N(Sk) is the set of nodes, and E(Ak,p) is the set of arcs determining \\nthe transaction from a node to another, due to an action a \\u2208 Ak, performed by an actor \\nP. A dangerous situation is detected when a transaction from a node nx to ny is due to \\nan action Ak such that a \\u03f5 Ak and a \\u2209 Ak,p. A security pattern for a resource is a path p \\non the graph GBAk. Continuous interactions along the graph shape the logical model of \\nthe BB CPSS. Security patterns constitute the building blocks of a security \\ninfrastructure, in the sense that any security infrastructure comes out from a \\ncombination of some security patterns. Unlike traditional security systems, where \\nsensors are only capable of detecting simple actions in an environment (eg motion \\nsensors), the IPS allows security management procedures based on complex and \\nstructured events. For example, traditional sensors are able to sense simple events like \\n\\u201ca strongbox is open\\u201d or \\u201ca human with a metal object is crossing the BB entering \\ndoor\\u201d recognizing them as dangerous events. The IPS sensors are able to sense \\nprimary events and learn, reason, and more effectively interact with humans inside a \\nBB, leveraging on machine learning algorithms to process the data collected and \\nrecognize only real dangerous situations. Appropriate machine learning algorithms \\nenable the IPS to combine security patterns to infer secondary events. More formally, \\nlet PBAk. be the set of admissible patterns on GBAk, (i.e. a sequence of actions \\nconsidered not dangerous for BAk\\u2019s safety and security), the IPS recognizes a threat \\nwhen it identifies an interaction such that p\\u2209 PBAk . In the previous example, the IPS \\nrecognizes that strongbox is open due to authorized scheduled refilling activities (p1) \\nand the armed human is a guard already authorized to enter the BB (p2). Since both p1 \\nand p2 \\u2208 PBAk , both are \\u201cfalse positives\\u201d threats and the IPS do not activate any \\nreaction measure.  \\n4.2.2 The Architecture of the IPS \\nThe IPS is able to manage many BBs as remote controlled CPSSs in order to both \\nincrease the degree of security and safety of the branches and reduce operational and \\nmanagement costs of the banking group protection system. We defined a logical and \\ntechnological model allowing the remote management of the BB CPSSs, able to \\nhandle data coming from synthetic sensors, video surveillance (passive safety), and \\nreal-time reports from employees and sensors (active safety). The network \\narchitecture of the IPS is described below. \\n\\u2022 \\nLocal Nodes: A local node is a local protection unit of a BB charged to manage \\nand control the BB CPSS. Local nodes make use of computer vision and \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    67 \\nsynthetic sensors technologies, able to carry out the local management of the \\nsignaling, comprising the correlation with the state of other software subsystems. \\nAny local nodes interact with the central node. \\n\\u2022 \\nCentral Node: A control room that collects signals from each CPSS (local node), \\nand is able to implement prevention or reaction risk protocols [35]. The central \\nnode uses embedded technologies in order to recognize each kind of threat. \\nThe IPS is a cognitive system since it is able to recognize the types of ongoing events \\nin each BB and suggest (or automatically adopt) in real time a set of appropriate \\ncountermeasures. The IPS continuously updates and upgrades its security patterns \\nsince it is able to learn from past criminal attacks, adopted countermeasures and \\neffects of such adoption. The IPS integrates efficient models and algorithms allowing \\nthe \\\"unstructured events\\\" video surveillance, in order to minimize the number of false \\npositive alarms and to minimize the number of not identified risky situations. Smart \\ncameras can be equipped with computer vision able to recognize human behaviour.  \\nThe IPS data-processing architecture is based on a web-based multi-tier solution \\nwhich makes use of an interprocess communication mechanisms typical of enterprise-\\ntype solutions. \\n \\n \\nFig. 1. The network architecture of the IPS \\nFigure 1 shows the different components of the IPS and how information flows \\noccur from the BB CPSSs to the control room.  \\n\\u2022 \\nSensor gateway: a network device able to collect heterogeneous data from \\nsensors. \\n\\n68 S. Ammirato et al. \\n\\u2022 \\nAlert management: represent all the alarm warnings generated by the sensors \\n(break-in, intrusion, etc.) that are sent as a textual list to the control panel \\n\\u2022 \\nData Communicator: transmission communication protocol among the \\nrecognition systems (which filter the alarms by assigning them a level of danger) \\nand the platform that will display them on the control panel. This communication \\nis based on XML / RPC web services. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Operator Panel: web interface for technical operators in order to \\nmanage security activities at an operational level. \\n\\u2022 \\nOperator Manager Panel: Management interface to analyse statistical data and \\nsetting up change to the security platform. \\n\\u2022 \\nDB: is the Data Base where will be saved all the events and decisions taken. \\nNaturally it contains the whole knowledge base of the system on the security \\nmeasures, security patterns and the risk model. \\nThe human interaction with security services is mediated by a ubiquitous \\ncomputing system and every smart object in the environment can potentially give \\neither an input to the IPS or an output to each person inside the smart environment. In \\nfact, the interaction is not centralized in a single device, but it involves a person, a \\npotentially huge set of smart objects distributed in the real world, and many security \\nservices running on the system. \\n5 \\nConclusions \\nSeveral authors highlighted the need for an integrated approach to managing physical \\nsecurity [36]. Physical protection systems leverage not only on technologies, but \\nintegrate people, procedures and equipment for the protection of goods or services \\nagainst theft, sabotage or any action aimed at harming people or property, implying \\nthe need for an integrated methodological approach. Physical security of people and \\nspaces (e.g. workplace, private and public areas), is becoming increasingly important, \\nand requires comprehensive and integrated solutions, characterized by ease of \\nconfiguration and immediacy of use. \\nThe availability of a new generation of multipurpose and low-cost sensors enabled \\nthe opportunity to easily redesign physical spaces as smart environments. In order to \\nexploit this opportunity, there is a need to design appropriate platforms able to \\nmanage and process data deriving from sensors. Thanks to the recent technological \\ndevelopments, it has become possible to integrate physical networks of SOs with \\ncognitive systems where applications can use such an intelligent infrastructure to \\ncarry out data analytics, process optimization and decision support. In particular, we \\npropose to deal with the traditional physical security issue of BBs under a CPSS \\nperspective. The technological infrastructure of a BB can be modelled as a CPSS \\nwhere smart and non-SOs used as protection measures, can interact among them and \\nwith humans through a digital network. Moreover, the introduction of an effective and \\ntailored Intelligent Protection System is responsible to manage an analyze data \\nacquired to synthetic sensors. \\nThe IPS we proposed combines a high level of security and safety within a bank \\nbranch to a more rapid access to the physical structure and an increased positive \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    69 \\nfeeling requested by the customers. The non-invasive sensor network designed within \\nthe platform realizes a more comfortable environment through the elimination from \\nthe customer's sight of protective elements of a crime, such as bars, revolving doors, \\ngunmen, etc., which, although currently necessary to prevent robberies, increase the \\nsense of anxiety. This is in line with the changing of commercial banking needs, \\nwhose marketing functions are pushing to let bank branches be more and more similar \\nto selling point of other industries. \\nOngoing studies are testing a prototype of the IPS in order to experiment it inside a \\nBB context. \\nReferences \\n1. \\nAshton, K.: That \\u201cinternet of things\\u201d thing.

On the other hand, our daughters may be \\nthousands of miles away from us \\u2013 and our partners either dead or on a cruise ship in \\nthe Caribbean. So we are \\u2018home alone\\u2019 \\u2013 but in contrast to the (now rather old) movie \\nhero that was 8 years old, we are 80+. Luckily, we are not totally alone as we have a \\nrobot that lives with us. The robot follows our routine and for some few days now is \\nspotting that: \\n\\u2022 \\nWe are missing meals \\n\\u2022 \\nWe are not taking any calls \\n\\u2022 \\nWe are not leaving home \\n\\u2022 \\nWe skip exercises and avoid taking our medication \\nIs it depression? Is it loneliness? Is there something that the robot should do to \\nhelp? In the European Horizons2020 MARIO project (www.mario-project.eu) we \\nhave been building Apps that would help the robot entertain persons with dementia. \\nBut we haven\\u2019t thought about reaching a higher level, namely of equipping the robot \\nwith the necessary consciousness model that will help it become a self-starter in many \\neveryday situations that a human might operate well. There is surprisingly much \\nresearch work and bibliography in the area of collaborative systems, some of which \\nalso relevant to elderly care, that can be of direct value and use in the area of human \\nrobot interaction. In this paper we aim to make clear the need for synergies between \\nthe two areas. \\n\\n396 A. Koumpis et al. \\nBy January 2018 our European research project MARIO (www.mario-project.eu) \\ncame to its end. In MARIO we introduced a humanoid care robot to help and facilitate \\ninteractions with persons with dementia \\u2013 an all in all difficult \\u2018target\\u2019 group [1]. \\nHowever, and going one level deeper in the project and its research agenda, we were \\naddressing the difficult challenges of loneliness and isolation in older persons with \\ndementia through innovative and multi-faceted inventions delivered by service robots. \\nThe effects of these conditions are severe and life-limiting. They burden individuals \\nand societal support systems. Human intervention is costly but the severity can be \\nprevented or mitigated by simple changes in self-perception and brain stimulation \\nmediated by robots. In [2] is stated that until the present, \\u2018loneliness is being treated \\nas a symptom of mental health problems; however, for elderly (aged 60 years and \\nabove), loneliness has become a disease in itself. There are epidemiological, \\nphenomenological, and etiological reasons to say that\\u2019. \\nWhat we have identified during the project lifetime and both as result of our \\nresearch activities, but also as result of our interactions with patients, their relatives \\nand the carers, is that there is well identifiable space which may have been treated as a \\nblindspot as of today and which concerns the area of modelling of human \\nconsciousness mechanisms to govern the robot. Human consciousness in our context \\nrefers both to the robot that may need to build some primitive \\u2018consciousness\\u2019 to \\nsupport its interactions with the humans in the form of empathy or affection, but also \\nfrom the side of the human user so that in case of loss of abilities due to dementia or \\nsome other reason, they will be assisted for a variety of functions and tasks. \\nThis means that while in MARIO project we mainly cared about offering \\ninterventions, there is need for some new research that will analyse human \\nconsciousness mechanisms, identify their main features, and identify the border \\nbetween human consciousness and unconsciousness to support reasoning, learning \\nand adaptation to varying emotional and behavioural patterns, conditions and \\npreferences.  \\nThe main outcome of such a research would be a software model of a robot \\nassistant that might offer functionality and features of a \\u2018virtual coach\\u2019 with an in-\\nbuilt evolution capability. At a first level, such a capability should be based on routine \\ntasks and some initial relevant physiological and behavioural data; over time it should \\nbecome more specialised to reflect the particular needs and preferences of each \\nindividual older person. \\nIn [3], the authors pose a rhetoric question, asking whether it is \\u2018possible to devise \\na general architectural principle that might lead an artificial agent to exploit what is \\ncalled consciousness in human beings and various animals?\\u2019, stating also that \\u2018in a \\nscientific and technological context, whatever formulation of consciousness one opts \\nto consider, consciousness should not come at the end of the day as an addition to an \\notherwise working description of a physical system\\u2019. For such a \\u2018working description \\nof a physical system\\u2019 it is that the authors of [4] recognize that one has to look into \\nthe construction of agent-oriented design processes, and more specifically what the \\nauthors call \\u2018the definition of the best way to create ad-hoc agent oriented design \\nprocesses\\u2019. In this respect, the development of consciousness as a multi agent system \\nwould, following the authors\\u2019 argumentation line, require \\u2018great efforts in learning \\nand using an existing design process\\u2019 and the main idea of the approach taken is one \\nhas to include in the design process also the system metamodel. \\n\\nThe Robot Who Loved Me \\n397 \\nIn [5] the author reports about the advances made in the IT industry in the area of \\nmachine reading (to avoid the term distant reading introduced by Moretti in [6] and \\nwhich has been in the last years mainly focused on the \\u2018reading\\u2019 of literature, and \\nwhat was considered as one of artificial intelligence\\u2019s holiest grails for many years. \\nWhat is interesting and relevant to our context here is a remark that one of the \\ninterviewed researchers (Ernest Davis, a New York University professor of computer \\nscience and AI researcher) provided, namely that this (: machine reading) is \\n\\u2018technically an accomplishment, but it\\u2019s not like we have to begin worshipping our \\nrobot overlords\\u2019, adding what epitomizes most successfully the point we take in our \\nresearch namely that \\u2018When you read a passage, it doesn\\u2019t come out of the clear blue \\nsky: It draws on a lot of what you know about the world\\u2019. \\n2. \\nThe Main Idea \\nThe idea of approaching real world objects through knowledge graphs automatically \\ncreated from multimodal information sources is, at least to our knowledge from the \\nliterature, uncommon. However, what might be a more uncommon idea is the case of \\nautomatically building and populating human consciousness models with the use of \\nknowledge graphs. \\nKnowledge discovery from digital big multimodal data can be done effectively by \\nemploying techniques like machine learning (such as Deep learning, SIFT), \\ndistributional semantics in NLP e.g. for text mining purposes and semantic \\naugmentation (use of domain specific formal ontologies) [7]. \\nHowever, and in order to facilitate the modeling of human consciousness, such an \\napproach can be seen as a process where studying the actual artefact (i.e. the human \\nconsciousness) is replaced by studying a latent (virtual) object consisting of a dense \\nnetwork of related information. This latent object is produced from secondary \\nsources, namely digital or digitised images and texts or other modalities, where the \\nimage or the text is used as an interface to the latent object, to which the human user \\nhas no access to.  \\nWe see a similarity with the case of an art historian studying artefacts from images \\nand catalogues or essays, or a medical doctor trying to identify pathogenies from \\nmedical images and test data. In both cases the form of information can be: \\n\\u2022 \\nstructured data (e.g. data from a collections management system records or \\nmedical test results)  \\n\\u2022 \\nunstructured text (e.g. free text description of an artefact) \\n\\u2022 \\nimages (e.g. digital or digitized images of museum objects, or CAT scans)  \\n\\u2022 \\nformalized domain knowledge existing in bibliography and in the experience \\nof the person examining the material  \\nThese sources constitute already a limiting approach to the true nature of the object \\nas such, since they constitute already \\u2018processed\\u2019 knowledge, thus eliminating facets \\nof it (e.g. same as 2D images provide us with information about the form of an object \\nfrom a certain perspective only, textual descriptions offer information only deemed \\nimportant by the author of the document, etc.).  \\n\\n398 A. Koumpis et al. \\nMoreover, the application of algorithms in these already secondary sources are \\nperceived as black boxes, thus giving the domain experts no transparent results to \\nconstruct an argumentation supporting their research. \\n3. \\nThe Need for a Collaborative Systems Perspective  \\nThere is a qualitative difference between the term need and this of a necessity; though \\nboth words are pretty close, denoting some similar condition, the difference between \\nthem lies on the prioritization, as while for a need there is an absolute demand, the \\nnecessity also relates to a craving without which a person manages to survive. \\nOur main position in this position paper is that there is a well identifiable space for \\nresearch to take place in the following years that will aim to support the field of \\nhuman-robot interaction and in particular the area of content-creation with research \\nthat will be, at a first level informed, and at a further level building on the work of \\ncollaborative systems. Work conducted and reported in [8] and [9] is of direct \\nrelevance in a variety of ways as we shall be able to indicate below, where we see a \\ngreat potential in the collaboration and the synergies for future research with the help \\nof the PRO-VE community. \\nIn [10], the authors state that \\u2018in order to have a robotic system able to effectively \\nlearn by imitation, and not merely reproduce the movements of a human teacher, the \\nsystem should have the capabilities of deeply understanding the perceived actions to \\nbe imitated\\u2019. In our context, we need to combine all existing knowledge patterns and \\ninformation sources that may be considered as relevant to a situation that our MARIO \\nrobot may encounter, while also relate them or, if more appropriately, match them \\nwith a situation that the robot may have just or recently encountered with a human \\nuser, like this of holding a conversation on a family matter (planning for the visit of a \\nrelative or need to have some medical tests). To this aim we take a holistic approach \\nthat combines bottom-up and top-down approach. In particular: \\n\\u2022 \\nbottom-up approach that is based on the employment of Big Data analytics \\ntechniques to explore what may in the future constitute some potentially relevant \\npatterns by having access to a vast pool of online media resources like social \\nmedia, internet discussion forums, blogs, etc. that are relevant to the discussion \\ntopic between the human and the robot, as well as a \\n\\u2022 \\ntop-down approach that takes as starting points existing patterns or instances of \\npast interactions between the robot and the human in the recent past, and check \\nfor their relevance. \\nAs one may expect, the superiority and the longer term sustainability and value of \\nour approach relates to the combination of both bottom-up and top-down approaches. \\nOnly the top-down would result into yet another \\u2018spell-checker\\u2019; only the bottom-up \\nwould result into an endless crawling of the Web where patterns might be ignored \\neven if they would exist because they couldn\\u2019t be identified using the current \\ninformation. Same as in crime forensics where DNA profiling may have been used \\nafter several years to identify individuals by characteristics of their DNA, our tools \\nshall offer the capability to store patterns that will be identified after some time, when \\nsome increased information will have been collected. This is an important feature of \\nour approach. \\n\\nThe Robot Who Loved Me \\n399 \\nFurther to this, complementary and potentially relevant patterns will be identified \\nby means of algorithms in statistical analysis and machine learning for sentiment \\nextraction and social network analysis (Bottom-Up-Approach). In particular, this \\napproach has the potential to uncover hitherto unknown patterns in the source data \\nand therefore enable the construction of new hate speech categories related to a \\nspecific field and knowledge base. The outcomes of both approaches will be united in \\na consistent, unified formal knowledge representation, to allow both for an extended \\nand improved understanding of the subjects of investigation and for a long-term, \\nversatile reusability of the collected data. At our group we have developed data-driven \\nmethods for data-driven decision making, recommendation and contextual suggestion \\nengines, using and/or developing algorithms for classification, clustering, rule \\nextraction and sentiment analysis. \\nTo the above one may find an instance of the problem of origins and first cause or \\nwhat we usually call as a chicken and egg situation. We have been all educated to use \\nin relational data and database modeling as this has been typically the prevailing \\nparadigm that was also driven by the structure of available data for many years now. \\nThe key question that has been driving the development, the research and the business \\nthere and is also used as the main design theme is: \\u201cWhat answers do I have?\\u201d \\nHowever, today\\u2019s problems and challenges as well as modern data and database \\nmodeling (what is also usually called as \\u2018NoSQL\\u2019) is typically driven by application-\\nspecific access patterns, i.e. the types of queries to be supported. So the main question \\nand also the main design theme here is: \\u201cWhat questions do I have?\\u201d \\nIt is for this reason that collaborative systems are relevant and highly necessary to \\nconsider as an enabling technology for all future developments in the areas of \\nintelligent systems and in particular for the area of human robot interaction.  \\nOne should be able to intuitively see the difference and also the parallels we see \\nwith the modelling of human consciousness. As an example we can imagine a library \\nwith all sorts of books \\u2013 the books that a person may have read in their lives. We are \\nall aware of the Dewey system \\u2013 or as it is properly called: the Dewey Decimal \\nClassification. This is an ideal role model example on why people came up with the \\nconcept and the idea of relational databases. And, by the way, this is a system that \\nstarted being shaped back in the 1870s. \\nHowever, if one imagines that our driver is not to find: \\n\\u2022 \\nif a book exists in our library or  \\n\\u2022 \\nwho has borrowed it,  \\n\\u2022 \\nwho is the publisher,  \\n\\u2022 \\nwhen it was published or  \\n\\u2022 \\nother similar \\u2018relational\\u2019 questions,  \\nbut: \\n\\u2022 \\nanything about the contents of the books,  \\n\\u2022 \\nanything that might be unexpected, unplannable, impossible or even at some \\npoint to consider as unworthy to even model when building our \\u2018neat and \\ncute\\u2019 relational database reality,  \\nit is in this case, where we don\\u2019t know which possible questions we have, where the \\nneed for adopting a collaborative systems approach comes on stage.  \\n\\n400 A. Koumpis et al. \\nThere is always a risk with the quality of the information acquired from unknown \\nsources \\u2013 a good example for this relates with the case of fake news. If the \\nconsciousness model for our case relies on any type of lesser value content such as the \\ncase of fake news, it is obvious that this will affect the quality of the model as such. \\nTo this problem, however, we can take a similar stand to the one we take in real life: \\nnot all people build their consciousness on the same sources or may be able to exhibit \\nsome evidence-based consistency in the way their consciousness models are built. But \\nit is therefore that a CN-based approach would increase the value of the end system, \\nas the aggregate results of such a consciousness model that comes as outcome of the \\ncollaboration amongst can will tend to be more accurate than any single entity alone. \\nThis collaboration aspect should be not mistakenly related to with crowdsourcing that \\nis rather the process where knowledge is obtained from the public at large through a \\nsystem of invitations and incentives [12, 13]. \\n3.1. \\nA Word on Ethics \\nThe ethics work during the MARIO project provided an innovative, integrated \\napproach to addressing ethical issues in robot design, research and implementation, \\naddressing the entire development process of the project [11]. As developed within \\nthe project lifetime, the ethics framework we developed provided a new \\ncomprehensive review of relevant interdisciplinary literature with relevance for \\nunderstanding ethical concerns regarding the use of care robots, a useful contribution \\nto the field of the ethics of care robots. In addition, its findings informed the approach \\nto data management in the project.  \\nOn the basis of the MARIO ethics framework, a set of innovative practical tools in \\nthe form of five ethics checklists were developed to guide ethical practice for different \\nstakeholders in robot development, research and implementation. These were tested \\nby different stakeholders, who found them to be helpful practical tools for their \\nrespective practice areas. An \\u201cethical encountered issues\\u201d form was employed during \\nthe pilots, to capture evidence on the incidence of actual ethical issues that \\nstakeholders encountered during trials. These indicated that careful implementation \\nwas required, but that users generally tolerated the robot well and distress was rare. \\nThese tools have the potential to be employed in different care robot projects, and \\nthe ethics tools and experiences from the project will be published to make them \\navailable to the international robot community, contributing to the development of a \\nsolid evidence base of ethical concerns in care robotics, which, if those results remain \\nas positive as during the MARIO project, is likely to facilitate wider societal \\nacceptance of the use of care robots in the care setting. It is interesting in this context \\nto take into account that in [14] the authors identify in relation to service robots a \\nproblem related, amongst others, with loss of control from the side of the elderly \\nperson due to robot monitoring and the interventions that the latter undertake within \\ntheir daily activities and routine. This is true at a great extent, and same as the (feeling \\nof a) loss of privacy and the (feeling of) infantilisation. However, one has to admit \\nthat the benefits of such a technology equal out at a great extent all potential \\ndrawbacks. \\n\\nThe Robot Who Loved Me \\n401 \\n4. \\nConclusions \\nDevelopments in the addressed area of modeling human consciousness in computable \\nand computer-processable forms are still in a fluid form. This poses a challenge for \\nbringing together a corpus of research that has taken and is still taking place in the \\narea of collaborative systems to identify and, if possible, also seize challenges that \\nwill change the way we perceive our idea for the use of robots in everyday tasks. The \\nresult of a robot intelligence will not anymore rely on its \\u2018hardwired\\u2019 intelligence but, \\nwith use of sentiment analysis and deep learning technologies, their capabilities to \\nextract information from a variety of modalities and media including videos, images, \\nnatural language, as well as structured data and then automatically transform them \\ninto \\u2018actionable information\\u2019 by means of deploying them in their interactions with \\nthe human users.  \\nIt is worth to mention here that in the MARIO project, as well as in the context of \\nthe present paper, we refer to robots that act as an extension of humans offering to \\nthem a symbiotic perspective, so these are not what one would consider as \\u2018truly \\nautonomous robots\\u2019. However, the aim to model aspects of the human consciousness \\nis dual namely on the one hand to replicate it in robots, while on the other hand to \\nhelp robots extend and complement the consciousness of people with decaying \\ncognitive ability. \\nFrom our research expertise it is evident that we promote the idea of exploiting \\ndevelopments in the areas of semantic technologies and statistical based natural \\nlanguage processing to facilitate the task of building data-driven models of body \\nconsciousness that will be possible to be easily populated with big data acquired from \\na variety of sources. Furthermore, we are able to see that the improvements to be \\nmade will seriously lag behind the needs that exist if our research shall not be \\ninformed and enriched with the perspective taken in the area of collaborative systems. \\nHuman intelligence is in all its aspects and manifestations such a system, \\nconsisting of a variety of entities and artifacts, demonstrating also characteristics of \\nautonomy as well as synergy, geography is also of importance with the ability to take \\nadvantage of geographical distribution as well as of geographical concentration, while \\nlast but not least, heterogeneity is also a key term as it affects all levels like the \\nculture, the socio-economic context, or even the daily (operational) routines. \\nIt may seem like a novelty to think of a future with networks of collaborating \\nrobots that are working together to offer a service to an individual. However, and \\nwhile from a technology stance this may be a novelty, from an organizational point \\nthis is not at all: currently, and for the care to an old person, there may be their \\nchildren that will interact with the physicians and the nurses. In the future, all these \\ninteractions may take place in an automated fashion by robots that will live with us \\nsame as the MARIO robot does with the persons with dementia. \\nAcknowledgements \\nThis work was supported in part by a grant from the European Union Horizons 2020 \\u2013 \\nthe Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014\\u20132020) under grant \\n\\n402 A.

The general context of this paper is the strategic planning of \\ndistribution centre warehouses. The idea is to anticipate changes in the \\nwarehouse based on objectives and issues generally linked to market (e.g.: \\nelectronic trade, etc.) and environmental developments (e.g.: last-mile logistics, \\netc.). Planning requires overcoming the consequences of the choices made as \\nwell as their interactions. To inform and justify projected technological choices, \\nit is crucial to identify and understand design rules which are often \\ncontradictory. Problems arise out of contradictions! To support strategic \\nplanning, the decision-making aid proposed in this paper consists of extracting \\nand formalising all problems in the form of contradictory design rules.  \\nKeywords: Warehousing systems, Strategic planning, Technology forecasting, \\nEvolution of warehousing, Cartography of contradictions. \\n1   Introduction \\nTo a large extent, the logistics costs of warehouses are determined during the design \\nphase [1]. As a general rule, based on a functional description, the warehouse design \\nphase consists of choosing a layout and associated technologies of the four core \\nactivities (receiving, storage, order picking and shipping), as well as a planning mode \\nfor the operations related to these activities [2], [3]. Changes in this functional \\ndescription are primarily correlated with the rapidly evolving market [4]. The \\nemergence of new consumption patterns, such as e-commerce for example, is likely to \\nimpose the introduction of new dedicated storage technologies, involving substantial \\ninvestment and high financial risks to boot.  \\nAs a result, it is imperative to plan and control the strategic evolution of logistic \\nwarehouses. Strategic planning decisions, generally characterised by a 10 to 15 year \\ntimeframe, relate to the determination of the general policies and plans for the use of \\nthe resources of the future warehouse [5]. \\nIn some cases, these evolutions can be promptly addressed via planned decisions; \\nthe activities associated with the decision are execution activities [6]. Conversely, \\nwhen there are no decisions relating to the new situation, a problem solving activity is \\nrequired. These unscheduled decisions are more difficult to examine as they involve a \\n\\n384 \\nD. Kucharavy et al. \\n \\nwide-ranging body of knowledge (endogenous and exogenous to the warehouse). This \\nbody of knowledge is often contradictory. \\nResearch projects undertaken in warehousing design primarily focus on \\nendogenous warehousing parameters [7], [8]. Few projects simultaneously factor in \\nendogenous and exogenous parameters. The warehouse of the future depends on \\nenvironmental developments. Market demands, limitations and trends bring about \\noperational, technological and organisational innovations and changes [4]. This \\ncontext raises two research questions. First question: what are the key characteristics \\nfor strategic decision-making in terms of warehousing design? Second question: how \\nto define a systematic method for identifying key warehousing design parameters?  \\nThis paper proposes a contribution to the first question only. The expected \\ncontribution is the formalisation of a number of generic design rules (means/effect) \\nusing an adapted language [7]. The expected nature of design rules is contradiction. \\nThe paper is structured as follows. Chapter 2 presents the theoretical framework. \\nChapter 3 presents the methodological framework to identify and extract generic \\ndesign rules. Chapter 4 presents an industrial application by a 3PL logistics provider. \\nFinally, chapter 5 concludes this paper and outlines research prospects. \\n2   Literature Review \\u2013 Theoretical Framework \\nA warehouse can be represented as a storage tank [9]. It has a buffer function in light \\nof the variability and uncertainty inherent in the supply chain. Its life cycle includes \\nthree major stages: design and construction; operation, development and \\nreorganisation; decommissioning or reprocessing. To consider conceptual design on a \\n5 to 10 year timeframe in terms of organisational architecture and processes, a reliable \\nvision of the demands, limitations and trends of the future warehouse is needed [4]. \\nThe strategic decision relating to warehouse evolution must take account of the \\ndynamic changes of the activities and functions, as well as the specific characteristics \\nof the system\\u2019s life cycle [10]. \\nStrategic decision-making in warehousing design is linked to the following generic \\nquestions:  \\n- \\nWhat are the achievable and unachievable performance levels?  \\n- \\nIs it necessary to modify the condition of the existing system?  \\n- \\nWhat is the effect of decision criteria on the new situation? \\n- \\nWhat are the most significant decision criteria in terms of system \\nperformance? \\n- \\nWhen decision criteria cannot be modified simultaneously, in what \\nchronological order should these criteria be modified? \\n- \\nEtc. \\nThe traditional approach in the design phase consists of inventing, creating \\npossible alternatives from which to choose. The rational decision-making model [11], \\n[12], is a 6-step process [13]: 1. define the problem; 2. identify decision criteria; 3. \\nweight the criteria; 4. develop alternatives; 5. assess alternatives (rule if criterion=\\u2026 \\nthen alternative=\\u2026); 6. choose the best alternative. This model is a sequential and \\nlogical structuring of the information to be analysed [5], [14]. The multi-criteria \\n\\nCollaborative Design of Warehousing 4.0 Using the Concept of Contradictions \\n385 \\napproaches generally undertaken [6] help select the best solution or the optimal \\nsolution from a broad range of solutions, the YES-NO type alternative being one \\nparticular case as part of a more general case. When alternatives are incompatible \\nwith the decision criteria values, a position must be taken in relation to these \\ncontradictions. \\nThis paper hypothesises that the problem solving process during the design phase \\ninvolves the identification of one or more contradictions resulting from the new \\ndecision context (e.g. market developments). Consequently, contradictions are the \\nexpression of a problem by consequences of the choices made, but obviously at least \\ntwo opposing consequences are required for a problem to arise. By expressing the \\ncause-and-effect relationships between means and performance, the contradiction \\nidentification process reveals the rules used. This helps clarify conflict areas, but also \\nand most importantly the reasons for projected technological choices. \\nTo advance the decision-making process towards a choice of technological \\nsolution, literature proposes several technological forecasting methods. Initial \\nsignificant research dates back to the early 20th century [15], [16], [17]. The primary \\npurpose of these methods is to provide a consensual view of the future technological \\nsituation [18]. A review of scientific journals, institutional reports and publications \\n[19], [20], [21] highlights methodological advances in terms of technological \\nforecasting for socio-economic and technological levels, rather than for the techno-\\nlogical level itself. The major improvements identified by the methods used to \\nforecast technological changes relate to a combination of existing techniques and \\nmodels, and the refinement of existing methods [22], [23]. The exponential increase \\nin the number of publications, institutions and researchers involved in forecasting and \\nthe development of technological forecasting methods in the past five decades has \\nyielded a multitude of techniques and methodologies [24]. \\nAfter reviewing the current practice of long-term technological forecasting \\nmethods, these methods can be classified into four categories [25]:  \\n(1) \\nphenomenological models (for example time series data extrapolations, \\nregressions),  \\n(2) \\nintuitive models (for example the Delphi method, structured and unstructured \\ninterviews),  \\n(3) \\nmonitoring and mapping (for example by reviewing the literature and sources \\npublished, scenarios, mapping of existing information), \\n(4) \\nand finally, the causal models used in this paper to analyse warehousing \\nsystem evolution rules.  \\nThe next chapter describes the method based on causal models. \\n3   Research Methodology \\nThe research-intervention method selected relies on the \\u201cResearching Future\\u201d method \\n(technological forecasting method) [26], [27]. This method combines maps of \\ncontradictions [28] with S-curves of logistics functions [29], [30]. The research \\nmethod follows the methodological triangulation principle. Triangulation is often \\n\\n386 \\nD. Kucharavy et al. \\n \\nused in management sciences. According to [31], [32], \\u201ctriangulation should support a \\nfinding by demonstrating that independent measures of it agree with or, at least, do \\nnot contradict it\\u201d. Denzin [33] highlighted three types of triangulation: the use of \\ndifferent data sources (time, space, persons); the use of different researchers; the \\nsimultaneous use of different methods. \\nTo obtain the map of contradictions, the \\u201cResearching Future\\u201d method used in this \\npaper connects the principles of the following methods: \\n- \\nthe \\u201cSystem Operator\\u201d model from the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving \\n- TRIZ [34], \\n- \\nthe \\u201cContradiction\\u201d model derived from TRIZ is developed to model \\nnetworks of problems within OTSM-TRIZ [35], \\n- \\nS-curves [30], \\n- \\ntechnology substitution models are used to measure the time and capacity of \\nevolution and substitution processes [36], [37], \\n- \\ninterpretation patterns of the knowledge obtained from the DITEK model \\n[38]. \\nThe contradiction representation language is illustrated in Fig. 1a. \\n \\n  \\nFig. 1a. Contradiction description model. \\nAn example of contradiction is described in Fig. 1b corresponding with the \\nfollowing interrogation: \\nIn the <distribution centre> system, the trend < significant flow heterogeneity> \\nencounters a barrier <storage profitability>. \\n \\n\\nCollaborative Design of Warehousing 4.0 Using the Concept of Contradictions \\n387 \\n \\nFig. 2b. Example of contradiction : handling productivity = number of (parcels or pallets)/hour; \\nstorage profitability = (storage turnover / m\\u00b2) / cost per m\\u00b2 of the storage surface area \\nThe semantics used are as follows: \\n- \\nElement \\u2013 everything (tangible or intangible) used in a combination to form a \\nwhole or a unit, \\n- \\nSystem \\u2013 group of elements interacting with each other, linked and \\ninterdependent, performing a certain function as part of a super-system. \\n- \\nTrend \\u2013 change in a system characteristic over a long period. \\n- \\nBarrier \\u2013 limitation of resources (e.g., space, time, energy), \\n- \\nParameter \\u2013 characteristic of an element which can be acted upon, \\n- \\nResult \\u2013 consequence of an action due to the value of a parameter (e.g. \\ndesired result); every indicator has a measurable value, measurement unit \\u2013 \\nstandard required to measure an indicator. \\nThe following syntax is used: \\nContradiction \\u2013 model to describe a problem through the description of a conflict \\nof interest. The contradiction model includes an element, a parameter, a parameter \\nvalue and an opposing parameter value, desired results (R1+, R2+) and unwanted \\nresults (R1-, R2-). Contradiction appears in the following case: when the evolution in \\nthe value of a parameter towards the R2+ desired leads to an unwanted R1-, and when \\nthe change in the opposing value of a parameter towards the R1+ desired leads to an \\nunwanted R2-. \\n4   Case Study \\nIntervention research is conducted in a French 3PL. Their turnover in 2016 was \\n\\u20ac2.045 billion. The scope of the study consists of 25 warehouses. Customers are \\nmainly from the agri-food, retail and healthcare industry. \\n \\n\\n388 \\nD. Kucharavy et al. \\n \\nA working group was assembled. The group includes 6 individuals, respectively 3 \\nexperts in 3PL and 3 researchers. The group had 26 meetings of 4 working hours over \\na 12-month period. The project management method is applied in generic stages:  \\n- \\nidentification of needs, \\n- \\nstudy scope specification, \\n- \\nidentification of stakeholders, \\n- \\nconsolidation of principal expert questions, \\n- \\nanalysis accuracy definition, \\n- \\nconsolidation of the expression of expected results. \\nTo define the scope of the warehousing system (WS), the primary function is \\nformulated and specified: \\u201cProvide customers with the desired quantity of products \\nwithin the desired deadline\\u201d. \\nTo comprehend significant changes in warehousing design and process, we \\ncollected chronological data on the surface area of the LP\\u2019s warehouses (m2). As the \\nbuilt-up surface and expected values are confidential information for the LP, no actual \\nfigure will be presented. The partial results of the study are presented in Fig. 2 and 3. \\nThe S-curves obtained help position the current WS in relation to its life cycle. S-\\ncurves are developed on the basis of 25 WSs spread over 13 countries. \\n \\n \\nFig. 2. Example of changes in the surface area of WSs built in France in m2  \\n(Tm=2005.5; \\u2206t=30.1; Rsquare=0.993) \\nThe increase in the surface area of existing WSs in France should stop by 2020 \\n(Fig. 2). At global level, it is estimated that saturation will be reached by 2022. New \\nwarehousing technologies should drive revenue growth without increasing the surface \\narea of WSs. \\nThe major characteristics of these new technologies are justified by the WS\\u2019s map \\nof contradictions. Every contradiction is developed based on an interrogation, trend \\nand barrier.  \\n\\nCollaborative Design of Warehousing 4.0 Using the Concept of Contradictions \\n389 \\nWhen formulating contradictions, certain interrogations were excluded from the \\nstudy as they were deemed irrelevant. Two new contradictions were identified. A \\nnumber of interrogations were aggregated and represented by the same contradictions. \\n \\n \\nFig. 3. Changes in the surface area of WSs built worldwide in m2  \\n(Tm=2008.9; \\u2206t=27.2; Rsquare=0.996) \\nAs a result of the work carried out by the working group, the outcome is \\ncharacterised by: 21 trends, 48 drivers, 49 barriers and 281 desired results. To \\nfacilitate the connection of contradictions, the 281 results are classified into six \\nindicator categories (Table 1). Fig. 4 presents a fragment of the map of the 58 \\nresulting contradictions. \\nTable 1.  Distribution of performance indicators and desired results by category.  \\nCategory \\nnumber of performance \\nindicators / category \\nnumber of desired \\nresults / category \\n1.

Flexibility \\n8 \\n19 \\nTOTAL : \\n88 \\n281 \\n \\nTo achieve a definitive description of the most significant contradictions (in terms \\nof changes in the WSs), the direct links between the contradictions formulated must \\nbe examined. This activity is under review. \\n \\n\\n390 \\nD. Kucharavy et al. \\n \\n \\nFig. 4. Extract from the map of 58 contradictions \\nThe map of contradictions represents the conflicts of interest between seven major \\nplayers (Fig. 5). The number of most significant contradictions concerns the logistics \\nprovider and the industrial producer, who are therefore the key players in the change \\nprocess. \\n \\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\n120\\nindustrial producer\\nthird-party logistics (3PL)\\nbranch warehouse\\nproduct-positioned warehouse\\ntransportation\\ndistributor\\nfinal consumer\\n \\nFig. 5. Number of connections classified by stakeholder \\n5   Discussions and Prospects \\nThe issue dealt with in this paper is as follows: \\u201cwhat are the key characteristics for \\nstrategic decision-making in terms of warehousing design?\\u201d. The result is the \\ndefinition of a map of ware-housing system contradictions. Problems are represented \\nin the form of contradictions for identifying major future WS characteristics. The \\n\\nCollaborative Design of Warehousing 4.0 Using the Concept of Contradictions \\n391 \\nresult achieved is described by a map of 58 contradictions. These contradictions are \\nobtained by linking 281 desired results (e.g. location of the ware-house) with 88 \\nperformance indicators (e.g. delivery times, etc.) classified into 6 categories (e.g. \\nlogistics cost, etc.). These contradictions concern 7 stakeholders (e.g. end user, \\ndistributor, etc.). The concept of contradiction is pertinent for initiating issues \\npertaining to the strategic evolution of WSs. \\nThe results obtained only allow for partial generalisation, as the scope of \\napplication is characterised by 25 WSs from the agri-food, retail and healthcare \\nindustry. The prospects of this study are the prioritisation of contradictions and the \\ndevelopment of a systematic method designed to identify contradictions. \\n \\nAcknowledgments.  \\nThis study was funded by FM Logistic Corporate SAS.

Protection of Bank Branches (BBs) represents an interesting setting \\nwhere potential benefits deriving from the introduction of IoT technologies can \\ngive best results in terms of operational performances. In this paper we present \\nmain results of an ERFD funded project aimed to redesign BBs as smart \\nenvironments. First, we summarize main results of a multiple case study among \\nItalian banking groups aimed to characterize the problem. Second, we propose \\nmain characteristics of a cyber-physical-social space (CPSS) specifically \\ndesigned to facilitate the rise of a smart BB. Third, we introduce the architecture \\nof a cognitive protection system designed to manage a network of BB CPSSs \\nbelonging to a banking group in order to improve both the degree of security \\nand safety inside the branch environment, and the operational performances of \\nsecurity management processes. \\nKeywords: Internet of Things; Intelligent Protection System; Cyber-Physical-\\nSocial Space; cyber-physical security; case study. \\n1   Introduction \\nOver recent years, the \\u201cInternet of Things\\u201d (IoT) concept is gaining more and more \\npopularity. Since Ashton first introduced this term in 1999, dealing with the \\nintroduction of RFiD sensors in supply chain management [1], the concept has been \\nevolving representing a new paradigm in which the Internet extends into the real \\nworld embracing everyday objects [2].  \\nAt the core of the IoT there are the smart objects (SOs), which are physical things \\nenhanced by electronic devices providing them with local intelligence and \\nconnectivity to the cyberspace [3]. Local intelligence means that SOs are able to \\nsense/log/interpret what\\u2019s occurring within the surrounding environment. SOs are \\nbuilding blocks for a smart environment where different kinds of SOs continuously \\nwork to make human interactions more comfortable and safer [4]. New research \\n\\n60 S. Ammirato et al. \\ndirections argue that sensing and connection is not enough: SOs should have the \\ncapability to learn, think, and understand both physical and social worlds [5]. This \\nemerging need to empower IoT with a \\u201cbrain\\u201d for a higher level of intelligence leads \\nto a new paradigm named Cognitive Internet of Things [5]. Cognition refers to the \\nability to be aware of the environment and the human interactions, be able to learn \\nfrom the past actions and use it to make future decisions that benefit the network [6]. \\nThus a cognitive information system is able to modify its behaviour on the basis of \\nexperience, data analysis and interaction of smart and not SOs. This approach \\nchallenges the way networks and systems are designed and operate with humans. \\nCurrent industrial trends and initiatives aim to \\u201cconnect the unconnected\\u201d, changing \\nthe way people and companies act every day in many key sectors, such as \\ncommunications, health care, finance, education, transportation, manufacturing and \\nagriculture [7]. An area that is becoming \\u201ca domain of major economic and social \\ninterest for the introduction of IoT\\u201d is the security domain [8]. Security of is a cutting \\nedge issue gaining growing attention in recent years. Today, millions of connected \\ndevices are used to enhance protection levels of many types of infrastructures under \\nthe IoT paradigm [9]. \\nBank Branches (BBs) represent an interesting setting where potential benefits \\nderiving from the introduction of IoT technologies can be best exploited. In fact, a BB \\ncan be seen as a worksite where humans interact among them and smart objects to \\ncarry out multiple banking activities (operational, economic and financial). The \\npresence of such characteristics enables, in principle, the shaping of a BB as a smart \\nenvironment and its devices controlled by a cognitive information system. \\nUnfortunately, the lack of sensible efforts in improving the BB protection system \\nrepresents the main hindrance to a full transformation of a BB in a smart environment \\n[10].  \\nThis paper reports results from the BaSS (Bank Security and Safety) project, \\nfunded under the EU ERFD program, which was aimed to support banking groups to \\ndesign a Cognitive Information System able to improve: \\n\\u2022 the degree of security and safety inside the branch environment \\n\\u2022 the operational performances of security management processes \\n2   Theoretical Background \\n2.1 \\nThe BB Security Context \\nBank branches are physical spaces that, traditionally, represent the contact points \\nbetween banks and their customers. Even if the growth of on-line banking is an \\nundoubtable trend, consumers being still more likely to use on-line channels for basic \\noperations continuing to rely on bank branches for more complex financial \\ntransactions [11]. Money transactions are moving from bank counter to remote \\ncontrolled platforms which are accessible via web (Internet/mobile banking) or placed \\nclose to the branch (ATMs) [12]. At the same time, the branch\\u2019s physical layout is \\nchanging. Traditional \\u201chard\\u201d security measures as visible security cameras, armour \\nwindows and metal detectors are going to be removed from customers\\u2019 sight. \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    61 \\nAlthough such measures are important to give protection to structures and people, \\nthey can generate a bad feeling of impending danger that can persuade customers to \\navoid entering in the branch or to stay within the branch the shortest possible time. It \\nis evident that the aim to reduce the sense of anxiety in customers, is in contrast with \\nthe need to guarantee protection of people and properties against criminal attacks. \\nA criminal attack can be viewed as a sequence of actions happening in an \\ninteraction space, with the aim to obtain an unfair benefit and/or damage people or \\norganizations [13]. The following table describes the categories of illegal actions (or \\nthreats) against BBs. \\nTable 1.  Threats against BBs. \\nThreat \\nDescription \\nT1: Robbery \\nstealing from a bank while bank employees and customers are subjected to \\nforce, violence, or the threat of violence, putting the victim in fear. \\nT2: Theft \\nthe illegal taking of another's property. \\nT3: Fraud \\nis the use of potentially illegal means to obtain money, assets, or other property \\nowned or held by a bank institution. \\nT4: Damage \\nintentional or unintentional harm to somebody\\u2019s property. \\n \\nFBI and EBF reports agree that criminal attacks against BBs are a problem that \\ncontinues to take a toll on financial institutions and communities across the U.S. and \\nEurope [14] [15]. Indeed, the growing number of attacks and their high rate of success \\nprove that current protection measures are still not so efficacy and overall protection \\nsystems are far from the global security concept. \\nThe occurrence of terroristic and criminal attacks at the international level, \\nemphasized the role of security and strengthened the importance to monitor and \\ncontrol critical. \\nTo improve degree of security and safety of people and goods inside a space an \\neffective protection system is required. Conrath [16] defined protection as the set of \\nmeasures that prevent or deter attackers from accessing to physical and logical \\nresources and guidelines on how to design structures to withstand hostile acts. While \\nin the past the emphasis was primarily addressed to the security of physical assets, \\ntoday, businesses and public institution of all sizes and industries perceive a growing \\nneed to protect people and intangible assets, to preserve the continuity of their \\nbusiness processes. In this sense, new approaches in designing protection systems \\nneed to combine the security needs with those of operational freedom.  \\n2.2 Smart Environment as Cyber-Physical-Social Systems  \\nSOs are able to detect and interpret what is occurring in the surrounding environment \\n(through an embedded sensor), interacting with other SOs, exchanging information \\nwith people and perform one or more actions through an actuator [17]. The \\nintegration of SOs within physical processes, by means of computation and \\nnetworking features, shapes the so-called \\u201ccyber-physical system\\u201d (CPS) [18]. A \\nCPS, which represents the technological layer of a smart environment, is able to \\n\\n62 S. Ammirato et al. \\nacquire and apply knowledge to offer context-based services to the environment [19]. \\nA CPS integrates two main aspects: \\n\\u2022 \\na cyberspace, that refers to the generalized information resources, including \\nvirtual and digital abstractions to achieve interconnections among cyber entities; \\n\\u2022 \\nand a physical space, that refers to the real world, in which physical objects are \\nrespectively perceived and controlled by sensors and actuators to establish \\ninteractions via the communication channels, remote collaboration, real-time \\nlocalization, and autonomy maintenance [20].  \\nTwo main functional elements characterize a CPS [21]: \\n\\u2022 \\nAdvanced connectivity ensuring real-time data acquisition from the physical \\nworld and information from the cyber space; \\n\\u2022 \\nintelligent data management, analytics and computational capability that \\nconstruct the cyberspace \\nBasing on the CPS paradigm, applications have been developed to assist people \\nactivities in many domains which become smart environments: transportation and \\nlogistics [21], smart buildings [22], smart health [23], etc. \\nNew approaches tend to consider human factors as an integrant part of the CPS \\ninstead of placing them outside its boundaries. In this sense, many authors proposed \\nthe concept of Cyber-Physical-Social System (CPSS) [24] [25]. CPSS extends the \\nconcept of CPS, including the so-called \\u201csocial space\\u201d domain, featuring human \\nparticipation and interaction among humans as well as human-computer interaction. \\nHence, it is possible to characterize a CPSS as comprising the following components:  \\n\\u2022 \\nSocial Space (SS): the human space containing human actors, relationships and \\nuser\\u2019s interconnected device (Internet of People \\u2013 IoP) \\n\\u2022 \\nCyberspace (CS): the software based systems and the underlying infrastructures \\nand platforms providing services to the users (Internet of Services \\u2013 IoS) \\n\\u2022 \\nPhysical Space (PS): the physical world of interconnected SOs, including \\nsensors, actuators and gateways (Internet of Object \\u2013 IoO).  \\nWhen coupled, the above-mentioned components led to the definition of the \\nfollowing subsystems characterizing a CPSS: \\n\\u2022 \\nHuman Computer Interaction (HCI): The human is not just an operator in a smart \\nenvironment, but he/she continuously interact with SOs/devices to get \\nmobiquitous services. \\n\\u2022 \\nCyber social space (CSS): virtual worlds, social networks and internet based \\nservices allowing synchronous and asynchronous relationship among humans. \\n\\u2022 \\nCyber Physical Space (CPS): integration of software based systems, platforms, \\nnetworking infrastructures and interconnected SOs and devices providing context \\nbased services. \\nAs stated in [25], CPSS appears to be an advanced version of the IoT paradigm \\nwhere social attributes are considered to address the integration of computation, \\nnetworking and physical processes aching the interfusion of the cyber\\u2013physical space \\nand social space.  \\nFrom an operational point of view, the design of a CPSS can benefit of the recent \\nadvances in mechatronics which led to a new generation of multipurpose sensors, \\nknown as indirect or synthetic sensors [26]. According this approach, single physical \\nsensor can detect different characteristics from the same signal, instead of requiring \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    63 \\nthe use of many sensors. The ultimate embodiment of this approach would be a single \\ngeneral-purpose sensor able to digitize an entire building. This kind of sensors can be \\nattached to a variety of objects, and without modification, sense many facets [27][28]. \\nSynthetic sensors overcome traditional limitations of limited sensing functionality, \\nlimited large scale interoperability and failure to provide complex interpretations of \\nimplicit assumptions [29]. \\n3 \\nMethodology \\nWith the aim \\u201cto develop technology-based solutions to important and relevant \\nbusiness problems\\u201d, the present study follows the design research paradigm proposed \\nin [30]. As stated in [31], a design science research process can be summarized on the \\nfollowing three steps: problem identification, solution design and validation. \\nThe first step was aimed to highlight characteristics and weaknesses of the \\nprotection systems currently adopted by banking groups to protect security and safety \\nof their branches. The framework methodology we have used at this step is based on a \\nmulti-methodological development approach that include a systematic literature \\nresearch and review and interviews with experts. Literature review was intended to \\ncreate a complete understanding of the BB security domain and IoT field of study. \\nMoreover, we performed semi-structured interviews with a sample of convenience of \\nsix respondents who were working for primary Italian banking groups as security \\nmanagers at the time of the study. The data gathering for the case study has been \\ncarried out in Italy during the last three months of 2016. The interviews were based \\non pre-defined open questions dealing with organizational and technological \\ncharacteristics of the current protection systems. The second step of the methodology \\nwas aimed to propose an architecture for a cognitive protection system for BBs able to \\nmanage protection through a redesign of the BBs. In particular, we introduce a logical \\nmodel of BB under a CPSS perspective and the architecture the architecture of the \\nIntelligent Protection System \\u2013 IPS, a cognitive platform designed to manage BB \\nsecurity. Third step consisted in testing activities in order to experiment it inside a BB \\ncontext. \\n4 \\nThe Italian BB Case Study \\n4.1 The BB Protection Systems \\nMeasures to protect the BB environment can be classified according to the desired \\neffect to a criminal attack: prevention and reaction. \\nPrevention measures are static measures intended to prevent/obstacle harms to \\nbank assets discouraging the potential criminals by doing the attack. Three typologies \\nbelong to this category: traditional \\u201chard\\u201d measures (structural measures such as \\narmour windows, armed guards, armour-plated doors, time lock doors); \\u201csoft\\u201d or \\npsychological measures (i.e: transparent glasses or display panels which gives \\n\\n64 S. Ammirato et al. \\ninformation about the presence of security controls, etc.), and \\u201ctechnological\\u201d \\nmeasures used to identify and enable/hinder people entering BB environment or \\ninteracting with ATMs, (e.g., secure ID generator, credit card; biometric data) [16].  \\nReaction measures require the activation (automatic or human driven) of a \\ncountermeasure further to a risky event (i.e.: sound alarm, systems for tracing money, \\nemergency calls to law-enforcement, etc.) [32]. Traditional ways to recognize suspect \\nbehaviours comes from perimetric/volumetric sensors and from two \\u201canalogic\\u201d \\nsystems that continuously monitor the environment: the armed guards and video-\\nsurveillance system. In both cases humans, directly (the armed guards) or indirectly \\n(the security guard looking at the video streaming from the control room) present on \\nthe scene are charged to pay attention to suspect behaviours of people who could \\nattack the BB.  \\nUnfortunately, interviews agreed that security measures are characterized by low \\nefficacy and by outdated and stand-alone mechanisms. Traditional \\u201chard\\u201d security \\nmeasures clash with commercial purposes of BBs. Protection measures currently \\nadopted cannot constantly monitor the environment properly: traditional camera \\nsurveillance systems are characterized by low effectiveness due to the tiredness and \\nthe alienation of operators because of the repetitive nature of the job. Moreover, \\nprotection measures are incapable of retaining, storing and communicating data about \\ntheir state in order to examine the contexts of BB. If available, contextual information \\ncould be used to support and enhance the ability to execute specific countermeasures \\nby providing information and services tailored to the security needs.  \\n4.2 Towards a New Concept of BBs as CPSSs \\nAs emerges from interviews, the growing interest of criminals in attacking BB is \\ndirectly related to the persistent use of obsolete security technologies that, moreover, \\nare a source of organizational inefficiencies, high costs and are characterized by long \\nreaction times and scarce level of effectiveness. \\nThe transformation of a BB in a smart environment can allow, in principle, to \\novercome these critical issues, improving security process performances and \\neffectiveness against criminal attacks. In the following sections we summarize main \\ncharacteristics of a CPSS specifically designed to facilitate the rise of a smart BB. In \\nthe so-called BB CPSS, protection measures, both smart and non-SOs, are capable of \\ninteracting among them and with humans through a digital network, to improve the \\nBB security and safety management. Inside the BB CPSS, the cyber domains of \\ncommunication and computing are combined with the dynamics of physical objects \\nand their interaction with human actors proper of a BB setting [19]. After, we \\nintroduce the architecture of the IPS - Intelligent Protection System \\u2013 which is the \\ncognitive protection system designed to manage a network of BB CPSSs belonging to \\na banking group in order to improve both the degree of security and safety inside the \\nbranch environment, and the operational performances of security management \\nprocesses. \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    65 \\n4.2.1 The Logical Model of a BB CPSS \\nEach BB environment is characterized by the presence of a set of context entities, \\nintended as physical or conceptual objects which interact among them [33]. \\nAccording to Ning\\u2019s view [25], it is possible to identify the subsystems which \\ncompose the BB CPSS and, for each of them, types of context entities interact inside:  \\n\\u2022 \\nSocial Space (SS): all the human actors which interact inside a BB. Four category \\nof human entities are identified: customers, employees, attackers and guards. \\n\\u2022 \\nCyberspace (CS): the local component of the IPS, that is a software based \\nsystems able to manage the security and safety operational process which happen \\ninside a BB. \\n\\u2022 \\nPhysical Space (PS): physical SOs and non SOs involved in security and safety \\nprocesses.  \\nThe following table provide a description of the main context entities of a BB \\nmodelled as a CPSS. \\nTable 2.  Main context entities of a BB modelled as a CPSS. \\nSpace Entity \\nEntity detail \\nDescription \\nSS \\nPeople \\nP1: Customer \\na person who is utilizing one or more of the services \\nprovided by the bank. \\n \\n \\nP2: Employee \\na person who works for a bank institution under a \\ncontract of employment. \\n \\n \\nP3: Attacker \\na person who is performing a criminal action to obtain \\nan unfair benefit and to damage someone or something. \\n \\n \\nP4: Guard \\noutsourced contractor monitoring for potential threats \\nto BB, on-site (e.g. armed guard) and remotely \\n(security guard inside the control room). \\nCS \\nIPS \\n \\nA web platform based on a client-server architecture \\nable to manage security and safety process within a BB \\nPS \\nBank assets BAk \\nthe set of tangible and intangible goods that are \\nthreatened by criminal attacks. \\n \\nWeapons \\n \\nany device used with intent to inflict damage or \\nthreaten people, structures, or systems \\n \\nSafety and \\nsecurity \\nsystems \\nNon SOs \\nstatic measures intended to prevent/obstacle harms to \\nbank assets discouraging the potential criminals by \\ndoing the attack (e.g. structural measures such as \\narmour windows, armed guards, armour-plated doors, \\ntime lock doors). \\n \\n \\nSOs \\nSOs that leverage on IoT features to provide security \\nand safety services. These systems require the \\nactivation \\n(automatic \\nor \\nhuman \\ndriven) \\nof \\na \\ncountermeasure further to a risky event. Such systems \\nare based on HCI or machine-to-machine interactions \\n \\nVolpentesta et al. [34] proposed that every action performed by context entities \\ninside a smart environment affects their state. Interactions between entities can be \\nsensed, interpreted and mediated through IoT based protection systems. In certain \\ncases, a subset of actions performed by humans in a BB can be recognized as \\n\\n66 S. Ammirato et al. \\nthreatening and may trigger a sequence of security service actions (e.g. a \\ncountermeasure) involving people (attackers, customers, employees) physical goods, \\nas well safety and security systems. We define \\u201csecurity patterns\\u201d the sequence of \\nactions involving context agents within a bank branch in order to detect of a threat.  \\nIn order to model security pattern, we used the following formalism. Let us \\nconsider Sk the set of all possible statuses of a Bank Asset BAk and Ak a non-empty set \\nof actions that can be performed on BAk. We assume that any action a \\u2208 Ak, performed \\nby an actor Pi-, determines a status change (from si,k to sj,k , i\\u2260j, si,k sj,k  \\u2208 Sk) of a Bank \\nAsset BAk. Each actor Pi is allowed to perform a set of activities Ak,i, where Ak,p \\u2286 Ak. \\nThe triple BAk (Sk, Ak, P(Ak)) univocally identifies the interaction graph GBAk(N(Sk), \\nE(Ak, P(Ak))), where N(Sk) is the set of nodes, and E(Ak,p) is the set of arcs determining \\nthe transaction from a node to another, due to an action a \\u2208 Ak, performed by an actor \\nP. A dangerous situation is detected when a transaction from a node nx to ny is due to \\nan action Ak such that a \\u03f5 Ak and a \\u2209 Ak,p. A security pattern for a resource is a path p \\non the graph GBAk. Continuous interactions along the graph shape the logical model of \\nthe BB CPSS. Security patterns constitute the building blocks of a security \\ninfrastructure, in the sense that any security infrastructure comes out from a \\ncombination of some security patterns. Unlike traditional security systems, where \\nsensors are only capable of detecting simple actions in an environment (eg motion \\nsensors), the IPS allows security management procedures based on complex and \\nstructured events. For example, traditional sensors are able to sense simple events like \\n\\u201ca strongbox is open\\u201d or \\u201ca human with a metal object is crossing the BB entering \\ndoor\\u201d recognizing them as dangerous events. The IPS sensors are able to sense \\nprimary events and learn, reason, and more effectively interact with humans inside a \\nBB, leveraging on machine learning algorithms to process the data collected and \\nrecognize only real dangerous situations. Appropriate machine learning algorithms \\nenable the IPS to combine security patterns to infer secondary events. More formally, \\nlet PBAk. be the set of admissible patterns on GBAk, (i.e. a sequence of actions \\nconsidered not dangerous for BAk\\u2019s safety and security), the IPS recognizes a threat \\nwhen it identifies an interaction such that p\\u2209 PBAk . In the previous example, the IPS \\nrecognizes that strongbox is open due to authorized scheduled refilling activities (p1) \\nand the armed human is a guard already authorized to enter the BB (p2). Since both p1 \\nand p2 \\u2208 PBAk , both are \\u201cfalse positives\\u201d threats and the IPS do not activate any \\nreaction measure.  \\n4.2.2 The Architecture of the IPS \\nThe IPS is able to manage many BBs as remote controlled CPSSs in order to both \\nincrease the degree of security and safety of the branches and reduce operational and \\nmanagement costs of the banking group protection system. We defined a logical and \\ntechnological model allowing the remote management of the BB CPSSs, able to \\nhandle data coming from synthetic sensors, video surveillance (passive safety), and \\nreal-time reports from employees and sensors (active safety). The network \\narchitecture of the IPS is described below. \\n\\u2022 \\nLocal Nodes: A local node is a local protection unit of a BB charged to manage \\nand control the BB CPSS. Local nodes make use of computer vision and \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    67 \\nsynthetic sensors technologies, able to carry out the local management of the \\nsignaling, comprising the correlation with the state of other software subsystems. \\nAny local nodes interact with the central node. \\n\\u2022 \\nCentral Node: A control room that collects signals from each CPSS (local node), \\nand is able to implement prevention or reaction risk protocols [35]. The central \\nnode uses embedded technologies in order to recognize each kind of threat. \\nThe IPS is a cognitive system since it is able to recognize the types of ongoing events \\nin each BB and suggest (or automatically adopt) in real time a set of appropriate \\ncountermeasures. The IPS continuously updates and upgrades its security patterns \\nsince it is able to learn from past criminal attacks, adopted countermeasures and \\neffects of such adoption. The IPS integrates efficient models and algorithms allowing \\nthe \\\"unstructured events\\\" video surveillance, in order to minimize the number of false \\npositive alarms and to minimize the number of not identified risky situations. Smart \\ncameras can be equipped with computer vision able to recognize human behaviour.  \\nThe IPS data-processing architecture is based on a web-based multi-tier solution \\nwhich makes use of an interprocess communication mechanisms typical of enterprise-\\ntype solutions. \\n \\n \\nFig. 1. The network architecture of the IPS \\nFigure 1 shows the different components of the IPS and how information flows \\noccur from the BB CPSSs to the control room.  \\n\\u2022 \\nSensor gateway: a network device able to collect heterogeneous data from \\nsensors. \\n\\n68 S. Ammirato et al. \\n\\u2022 \\nAlert management: represent all the alarm warnings generated by the sensors \\n(break-in, intrusion, etc.) that are sent as a textual list to the control panel \\n\\u2022 \\nData Communicator: transmission communication protocol among the \\nrecognition systems (which filter the alarms by assigning them a level of danger) \\nand the platform that will display them on the control panel. This communication \\nis based on XML / RPC web services. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Operator Panel: web interface for technical operators in order to \\nmanage security activities at an operational level. \\n\\u2022 \\nOperator Manager Panel: Management interface to analyse statistical data and \\nsetting up change to the security platform. \\n\\u2022 \\nDB: is the Data Base where will be saved all the events and decisions taken. \\nNaturally it contains the whole knowledge base of the system on the security \\nmeasures, security patterns and the risk model. \\nThe human interaction with security services is mediated by a ubiquitous \\ncomputing system and every smart object in the environment can potentially give \\neither an input to the IPS or an output to each person inside the smart environment. In \\nfact, the interaction is not centralized in a single device, but it involves a person, a \\npotentially huge set of smart objects distributed in the real world, and many security \\nservices running on the system. \\n5 \\nConclusions \\nSeveral authors highlighted the need for an integrated approach to managing physical \\nsecurity [36]. Physical protection systems leverage not only on technologies, but \\nintegrate people, procedures and equipment for the protection of goods or services \\nagainst theft, sabotage or any action aimed at harming people or property, implying \\nthe need for an integrated methodological approach. Physical security of people and \\nspaces (e.g. workplace, private and public areas), is becoming increasingly important, \\nand requires comprehensive and integrated solutions, characterized by ease of \\nconfiguration and immediacy of use. \\nThe availability of a new generation of multipurpose and low-cost sensors enabled \\nthe opportunity to easily redesign physical spaces as smart environments. In order to \\nexploit this opportunity, there is a need to design appropriate platforms able to \\nmanage and process data deriving from sensors. Thanks to the recent technological \\ndevelopments, it has become possible to integrate physical networks of SOs with \\ncognitive systems where applications can use such an intelligent infrastructure to \\ncarry out data analytics, process optimization and decision support. In particular, we \\npropose to deal with the traditional physical security issue of BBs under a CPSS \\nperspective. The technological infrastructure of a BB can be modelled as a CPSS \\nwhere smart and non-SOs used as protection measures, can interact among them and \\nwith humans through a digital network. Moreover, the introduction of an effective and \\ntailored Intelligent Protection System is responsible to manage an analyze data \\nacquired to synthetic sensors. \\nThe IPS we proposed combines a high level of security and safety within a bank \\nbranch to a more rapid access to the physical structure and an increased positive \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    69 \\nfeeling requested by the customers. The non-invasive sensor network designed within \\nthe platform realizes a more comfortable environment through the elimination from \\nthe customer's sight of protective elements of a crime, such as bars, revolving doors, \\ngunmen, etc., which, although currently necessary to prevent robberies, increase the \\nsense of anxiety. This is in line with the changing of commercial banking needs, \\nwhose marketing functions are pushing to let bank branches be more and more similar \\nto selling point of other industries. \\nOngoing studies are testing a prototype of the IPS in order to experiment it inside a \\nBB context. \\nReferences \\n1. \\nAshton, K.: That \\u201cinternet of things\\u201d thing.

On the other hand, our daughters may be \\nthousands of miles away from us \\u2013 and our partners either dead or on a cruise ship in \\nthe Caribbean. So we are \\u2018home alone\\u2019 \\u2013 but in contrast to the (now rather old) movie \\nhero that was 8 years old, we are 80+. Luckily, we are not totally alone as we have a \\nrobot that lives with us. The robot follows our routine and for some few days now is \\nspotting that: \\n\\u2022 \\nWe are missing meals \\n\\u2022 \\nWe are not taking any calls \\n\\u2022 \\nWe are not leaving home \\n\\u2022 \\nWe skip exercises and avoid taking our medication \\nIs it depression? Is it loneliness? Is there something that the robot should do to \\nhelp? In the European Horizons2020 MARIO project (www.mario-project.eu) we \\nhave been building Apps that would help the robot entertain persons with dementia. \\nBut we haven\\u2019t thought about reaching a higher level, namely of equipping the robot \\nwith the necessary consciousness model that will help it become a self-starter in many \\neveryday situations that a human might operate well. There is surprisingly much \\nresearch work and bibliography in the area of collaborative systems, some of which \\nalso relevant to elderly care, that can be of direct value and use in the area of human \\nrobot interaction. In this paper we aim to make clear the need for synergies between \\nthe two areas. \\n\\n396 A. Koumpis et al. \\nBy January 2018 our European research project MARIO (www.mario-project.eu) \\ncame to its end. In MARIO we introduced a humanoid care robot to help and facilitate \\ninteractions with persons with dementia \\u2013 an all in all difficult \\u2018target\\u2019 group [1]. \\nHowever, and going one level deeper in the project and its research agenda, we were \\naddressing the difficult challenges of loneliness and isolation in older persons with \\ndementia through innovative and multi-faceted inventions delivered by service robots. \\nThe effects of these conditions are severe and life-limiting. They burden individuals \\nand societal support systems. Human intervention is costly but the severity can be \\nprevented or mitigated by simple changes in self-perception and brain stimulation \\nmediated by robots. In [2] is stated that until the present, \\u2018loneliness is being treated \\nas a symptom of mental health problems; however, for elderly (aged 60 years and \\nabove), loneliness has become a disease in itself. There are epidemiological, \\nphenomenological, and etiological reasons to say that\\u2019. \\nWhat we have identified during the project lifetime and both as result of our \\nresearch activities, but also as result of our interactions with patients, their relatives \\nand the carers, is that there is well identifiable space which may have been treated as a \\nblindspot as of today and which concerns the area of modelling of human \\nconsciousness mechanisms to govern the robot. Human consciousness in our context \\nrefers both to the robot that may need to build some primitive \\u2018consciousness\\u2019 to \\nsupport its interactions with the humans in the form of empathy or affection, but also \\nfrom the side of the human user so that in case of loss of abilities due to dementia or \\nsome other reason, they will be assisted for a variety of functions and tasks. \\nThis means that while in MARIO project we mainly cared about offering \\ninterventions, there is need for some new research that will analyse human \\nconsciousness mechanisms, identify their main features, and identify the border \\nbetween human consciousness and unconsciousness to support reasoning, learning \\nand adaptation to varying emotional and behavioural patterns, conditions and \\npreferences.  \\nThe main outcome of such a research would be a software model of a robot \\nassistant that might offer functionality and features of a \\u2018virtual coach\\u2019 with an in-\\nbuilt evolution capability. At a first level, such a capability should be based on routine \\ntasks and some initial relevant physiological and behavioural data; over time it should \\nbecome more specialised to reflect the particular needs and preferences of each \\nindividual older person. \\nIn [3], the authors pose a rhetoric question, asking whether it is \\u2018possible to devise \\na general architectural principle that might lead an artificial agent to exploit what is \\ncalled consciousness in human beings and various animals?\\u2019, stating also that \\u2018in a \\nscientific and technological context, whatever formulation of consciousness one opts \\nto consider, consciousness should not come at the end of the day as an addition to an \\notherwise working description of a physical system\\u2019. For such a \\u2018working description \\nof a physical system\\u2019 it is that the authors of [4] recognize that one has to look into \\nthe construction of agent-oriented design processes, and more specifically what the \\nauthors call \\u2018the definition of the best way to create ad-hoc agent oriented design \\nprocesses\\u2019. In this respect, the development of consciousness as a multi agent system \\nwould, following the authors\\u2019 argumentation line, require \\u2018great efforts in learning \\nand using an existing design process\\u2019 and the main idea of the approach taken is one \\nhas to include in the design process also the system metamodel. \\n\\nThe Robot Who Loved Me \\n397 \\nIn [5] the author reports about the advances made in the IT industry in the area of \\nmachine reading (to avoid the term distant reading introduced by Moretti in [6] and \\nwhich has been in the last years mainly focused on the \\u2018reading\\u2019 of literature, and \\nwhat was considered as one of artificial intelligence\\u2019s holiest grails for many years. \\nWhat is interesting and relevant to our context here is a remark that one of the \\ninterviewed researchers (Ernest Davis, a New York University professor of computer \\nscience and AI researcher) provided, namely that this (: machine reading) is \\n\\u2018technically an accomplishment, but it\\u2019s not like we have to begin worshipping our \\nrobot overlords\\u2019, adding what epitomizes most successfully the point we take in our \\nresearch namely that \\u2018When you read a passage, it doesn\\u2019t come out of the clear blue \\nsky: It draws on a lot of what you know about the world\\u2019. \\n2. \\nThe Main Idea \\nThe idea of approaching real world objects through knowledge graphs automatically \\ncreated from multimodal information sources is, at least to our knowledge from the \\nliterature, uncommon. However, what might be a more uncommon idea is the case of \\nautomatically building and populating human consciousness models with the use of \\nknowledge graphs. \\nKnowledge discovery from digital big multimodal data can be done effectively by \\nemploying techniques like machine learning (such as Deep learning, SIFT), \\ndistributional semantics in NLP e.g. for text mining purposes and semantic \\naugmentation (use of domain specific formal ontologies) [7]. \\nHowever, and in order to facilitate the modeling of human consciousness, such an \\napproach can be seen as a process where studying the actual artefact (i.e. the human \\nconsciousness) is replaced by studying a latent (virtual) object consisting of a dense \\nnetwork of related information. This latent object is produced from secondary \\nsources, namely digital or digitised images and texts or other modalities, where the \\nimage or the text is used as an interface to the latent object, to which the human user \\nhas no access to.  \\nWe see a similarity with the case of an art historian studying artefacts from images \\nand catalogues or essays, or a medical doctor trying to identify pathogenies from \\nmedical images and test data. In both cases the form of information can be: \\n\\u2022 \\nstructured data (e.g. data from a collections management system records or \\nmedical test results)  \\n\\u2022 \\nunstructured text (e.g. free text description of an artefact) \\n\\u2022 \\nimages (e.g. digital or digitized images of museum objects, or CAT scans)  \\n\\u2022 \\nformalized domain knowledge existing in bibliography and in the experience \\nof the person examining the material  \\nThese sources constitute already a limiting approach to the true nature of the object \\nas such, since they constitute already \\u2018processed\\u2019 knowledge, thus eliminating facets \\nof it (e.g. same as 2D images provide us with information about the form of an object \\nfrom a certain perspective only, textual descriptions offer information only deemed \\nimportant by the author of the document, etc.).  \\n\\n398 A. Koumpis et al. \\nMoreover, the application of algorithms in these already secondary sources are \\nperceived as black boxes, thus giving the domain experts no transparent results to \\nconstruct an argumentation supporting their research. \\n3. \\nThe Need for a Collaborative Systems Perspective  \\nThere is a qualitative difference between the term need and this of a necessity; though \\nboth words are pretty close, denoting some similar condition, the difference between \\nthem lies on the prioritization, as while for a need there is an absolute demand, the \\nnecessity also relates to a craving without which a person manages to survive. \\nOur main position in this position paper is that there is a well identifiable space for \\nresearch to take place in the following years that will aim to support the field of \\nhuman-robot interaction and in particular the area of content-creation with research \\nthat will be, at a first level informed, and at a further level building on the work of \\ncollaborative systems. Work conducted and reported in [8] and [9] is of direct \\nrelevance in a variety of ways as we shall be able to indicate below, where we see a \\ngreat potential in the collaboration and the synergies for future research with the help \\nof the PRO-VE community. \\nIn [10], the authors state that \\u2018in order to have a robotic system able to effectively \\nlearn by imitation, and not merely reproduce the movements of a human teacher, the \\nsystem should have the capabilities of deeply understanding the perceived actions to \\nbe imitated\\u2019. In our context, we need to combine all existing knowledge patterns and \\ninformation sources that may be considered as relevant to a situation that our MARIO \\nrobot may encounter, while also relate them or, if more appropriately, match them \\nwith a situation that the robot may have just or recently encountered with a human \\nuser, like this of holding a conversation on a family matter (planning for the visit of a \\nrelative or need to have some medical tests). To this aim we take a holistic approach \\nthat combines bottom-up and top-down approach. In particular: \\n\\u2022 \\nbottom-up approach that is based on the employment of Big Data analytics \\ntechniques to explore what may in the future constitute some potentially relevant \\npatterns by having access to a vast pool of online media resources like social \\nmedia, internet discussion forums, blogs, etc. that are relevant to the discussion \\ntopic between the human and the robot, as well as a \\n\\u2022 \\ntop-down approach that takes as starting points existing patterns or instances of \\npast interactions between the robot and the human in the recent past, and check \\nfor their relevance. \\nAs one may expect, the superiority and the longer term sustainability and value of \\nour approach relates to the combination of both bottom-up and top-down approaches. \\nOnly the top-down would result into yet another \\u2018spell-checker\\u2019; only the bottom-up \\nwould result into an endless crawling of the Web where patterns might be ignored \\neven if they would exist because they couldn\\u2019t be identified using the current \\ninformation. Same as in crime forensics where DNA profiling may have been used \\nafter several years to identify individuals by characteristics of their DNA, our tools \\nshall offer the capability to store patterns that will be identified after some time, when \\nsome increased information will have been collected. This is an important feature of \\nour approach. \\n\\nThe Robot Who Loved Me \\n399 \\nFurther to this, complementary and potentially relevant patterns will be identified \\nby means of algorithms in statistical analysis and machine learning for sentiment \\nextraction and social network analysis (Bottom-Up-Approach). In particular, this \\napproach has the potential to uncover hitherto unknown patterns in the source data \\nand therefore enable the construction of new hate speech categories related to a \\nspecific field and knowledge base. The outcomes of both approaches will be united in \\na consistent, unified formal knowledge representation, to allow both for an extended \\nand improved understanding of the subjects of investigation and for a long-term, \\nversatile reusability of the collected data. At our group we have developed data-driven \\nmethods for data-driven decision making, recommendation and contextual suggestion \\nengines, using and/or developing algorithms for classification, clustering, rule \\nextraction and sentiment analysis. \\nTo the above one may find an instance of the problem of origins and first cause or \\nwhat we usually call as a chicken and egg situation. We have been all educated to use \\nin relational data and database modeling as this has been typically the prevailing \\nparadigm that was also driven by the structure of available data for many years now. \\nThe key question that has been driving the development, the research and the business \\nthere and is also used as the main design theme is: \\u201cWhat answers do I have?\\u201d \\nHowever, today\\u2019s problems and challenges as well as modern data and database \\nmodeling (what is also usually called as \\u2018NoSQL\\u2019) is typically driven by application-\\nspecific access patterns, i.e. the types of queries to be supported. So the main question \\nand also the main design theme here is: \\u201cWhat questions do I have?\\u201d \\nIt is for this reason that collaborative systems are relevant and highly necessary to \\nconsider as an enabling technology for all future developments in the areas of \\nintelligent systems and in particular for the area of human robot interaction.  \\nOne should be able to intuitively see the difference and also the parallels we see \\nwith the modelling of human consciousness. As an example we can imagine a library \\nwith all sorts of books \\u2013 the books that a person may have read in their lives. We are \\nall aware of the Dewey system \\u2013 or as it is properly called: the Dewey Decimal \\nClassification. This is an ideal role model example on why people came up with the \\nconcept and the idea of relational databases. And, by the way, this is a system that \\nstarted being shaped back in the 1870s. \\nHowever, if one imagines that our driver is not to find: \\n\\u2022 \\nif a book exists in our library or  \\n\\u2022 \\nwho has borrowed it,  \\n\\u2022 \\nwho is the publisher,  \\n\\u2022 \\nwhen it was published or  \\n\\u2022 \\nother similar \\u2018relational\\u2019 questions,  \\nbut: \\n\\u2022 \\nanything about the contents of the books,  \\n\\u2022 \\nanything that might be unexpected, unplannable, impossible or even at some \\npoint to consider as unworthy to even model when building our \\u2018neat and \\ncute\\u2019 relational database reality,  \\nit is in this case, where we don\\u2019t know which possible questions we have, where the \\nneed for adopting a collaborative systems approach comes on stage.  \\n\\n400 A. Koumpis et al. \\nThere is always a risk with the quality of the information acquired from unknown \\nsources \\u2013 a good example for this relates with the case of fake news. If the \\nconsciousness model for our case relies on any type of lesser value content such as the \\ncase of fake news, it is obvious that this will affect the quality of the model as such. \\nTo this problem, however, we can take a similar stand to the one we take in real life: \\nnot all people build their consciousness on the same sources or may be able to exhibit \\nsome evidence-based consistency in the way their consciousness models are built. But \\nit is therefore that a CN-based approach would increase the value of the end system, \\nas the aggregate results of such a consciousness model that comes as outcome of the \\ncollaboration amongst can will tend to be more accurate than any single entity alone. \\nThis collaboration aspect should be not mistakenly related to with crowdsourcing that \\nis rather the process where knowledge is obtained from the public at large through a \\nsystem of invitations and incentives [12, 13]. \\n3.1. \\nA Word on Ethics \\nThe ethics work during the MARIO project provided an innovative, integrated \\napproach to addressing ethical issues in robot design, research and implementation, \\naddressing the entire development process of the project [11]. As developed within \\nthe project lifetime, the ethics framework we developed provided a new \\ncomprehensive review of relevant interdisciplinary literature with relevance for \\nunderstanding ethical concerns regarding the use of care robots, a useful contribution \\nto the field of the ethics of care robots. In addition, its findings informed the approach \\nto data management in the project.  \\nOn the basis of the MARIO ethics framework, a set of innovative practical tools in \\nthe form of five ethics checklists were developed to guide ethical practice for different \\nstakeholders in robot development, research and implementation. These were tested \\nby different stakeholders, who found them to be helpful practical tools for their \\nrespective practice areas. An \\u201cethical encountered issues\\u201d form was employed during \\nthe pilots, to capture evidence on the incidence of actual ethical issues that \\nstakeholders encountered during trials. These indicated that careful implementation \\nwas required, but that users generally tolerated the robot well and distress was rare. \\nThese tools have the potential to be employed in different care robot projects, and \\nthe ethics tools and experiences from the project will be published to make them \\navailable to the international robot community, contributing to the development of a \\nsolid evidence base of ethical concerns in care robotics, which, if those results remain \\nas positive as during the MARIO project, is likely to facilitate wider societal \\nacceptance of the use of care robots in the care setting. It is interesting in this context \\nto take into account that in [14] the authors identify in relation to service robots a \\nproblem related, amongst others, with loss of control from the side of the elderly \\nperson due to robot monitoring and the interventions that the latter undertake within \\ntheir daily activities and routine. This is true at a great extent, and same as the (feeling \\nof a) loss of privacy and the (feeling of) infantilisation. However, one has to admit \\nthat the benefits of such a technology equal out at a great extent all potential \\ndrawbacks. \\n\\nThe Robot Who Loved Me \\n401 \\n4. \\nConclusions \\nDevelopments in the addressed area of modeling human consciousness in computable \\nand computer-processable forms are still in a fluid form. This poses a challenge for \\nbringing together a corpus of research that has taken and is still taking place in the \\narea of collaborative systems to identify and, if possible, also seize challenges that \\nwill change the way we perceive our idea for the use of robots in everyday tasks. The \\nresult of a robot intelligence will not anymore rely on its \\u2018hardwired\\u2019 intelligence but, \\nwith use of sentiment analysis and deep learning technologies, their capabilities to \\nextract information from a variety of modalities and media including videos, images, \\nnatural language, as well as structured data and then automatically transform them \\ninto \\u2018actionable information\\u2019 by means of deploying them in their interactions with \\nthe human users.  \\nIt is worth to mention here that in the MARIO project, as well as in the context of \\nthe present paper, we refer to robots that act as an extension of humans offering to \\nthem a symbiotic perspective, so these are not what one would consider as \\u2018truly \\nautonomous robots\\u2019. However, the aim to model aspects of the human consciousness \\nis dual namely on the one hand to replicate it in robots, while on the other hand to \\nhelp robots extend and complement the consciousness of people with decaying \\ncognitive ability. \\nFrom our research expertise it is evident that we promote the idea of exploiting \\ndevelopments in the areas of semantic technologies and statistical based natural \\nlanguage processing to facilitate the task of building data-driven models of body \\nconsciousness that will be possible to be easily populated with big data acquired from \\na variety of sources. Furthermore, we are able to see that the improvements to be \\nmade will seriously lag behind the needs that exist if our research shall not be \\ninformed and enriched with the perspective taken in the area of collaborative systems. \\nHuman intelligence is in all its aspects and manifestations such a system, \\nconsisting of a variety of entities and artifacts, demonstrating also characteristics of \\nautonomy as well as synergy, geography is also of importance with the ability to take \\nadvantage of geographical distribution as well as of geographical concentration, while \\nlast but not least, heterogeneity is also a key term as it affects all levels like the \\nculture, the socio-economic context, or even the daily (operational) routines. \\nIt may seem like a novelty to think of a future with networks of collaborating \\nrobots that are working together to offer a service to an individual. However, and \\nwhile from a technology stance this may be a novelty, from an organizational point \\nthis is not at all: currently, and for the care to an old person, there may be their \\nchildren that will interact with the physicians and the nurses. In the future, all these \\ninteractions may take place in an automated fashion by robots that will live with us \\nsame as the MARIO robot does with the persons with dementia. \\nAcknowledgements \\nThis work was supported in part by a grant from the European Union Horizons 2020 \\u2013 \\nthe Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014\\u20132020) under grant \\n\\n402 A.

The general context of this paper is the strategic planning of \\ndistribution centre warehouses. The idea is to anticipate changes in the \\nwarehouse based on objectives and issues generally linked to market (e.g.: \\nelectronic trade, etc.) and environmental developments (e.g.: last-mile logistics, \\netc.). Planning requires overcoming the consequences of the choices made as \\nwell as their interactions. To inform and justify projected technological choices, \\nit is crucial to identify and understand design rules which are often \\ncontradictory. Problems arise out of contradictions! To support strategic \\nplanning, the decision-making aid proposed in this paper consists of extracting \\nand formalising all problems in the form of contradictory design rules.  \\nKeywords: Warehousing systems, Strategic planning, Technology forecasting, \\nEvolution of warehousing, Cartography of contradictions. \\n1   Introduction \\nTo a large extent, the logistics costs of warehouses are determined during the design \\nphase [1]. As a general rule, based on a functional description, the warehouse design \\nphase consists of choosing a layout and associated technologies of the four core \\nactivities (receiving, storage, order picking and shipping), as well as a planning mode \\nfor the operations related to these activities [2], [3]. Changes in this functional \\ndescription are primarily correlated with the rapidly evolving market [4]. The \\nemergence of new consumption patterns, such as e-commerce for example, is likely to \\nimpose the introduction of new dedicated storage technologies, involving substantial \\ninvestment and high financial risks to boot.  \\nAs a result, it is imperative to plan and control the strategic evolution of logistic \\nwarehouses. Strategic planning decisions, generally characterised by a 10 to 15 year \\ntimeframe, relate to the determination of the general policies and plans for the use of \\nthe resources of the future warehouse [5]. \\nIn some cases, these evolutions can be promptly addressed via planned decisions; \\nthe activities associated with the decision are execution activities [6]. Conversely, \\nwhen there are no decisions relating to the new situation, a problem solving activity is \\nrequired. These unscheduled decisions are more difficult to examine as they involve a \\n\\n384 \\nD. Kucharavy et al. \\n \\nwide-ranging body of knowledge (endogenous and exogenous to the warehouse). This \\nbody of knowledge is often contradictory. \\nResearch projects undertaken in warehousing design primarily focus on \\nendogenous warehousing parameters [7], [8]. Few projects simultaneously factor in \\nendogenous and exogenous parameters. The warehouse of the future depends on \\nenvironmental developments. Market demands, limitations and trends bring about \\noperational, technological and organisational innovations and changes [4]. This \\ncontext raises two research questions. First question: what are the key characteristics \\nfor strategic decision-making in terms of warehousing design? Second question: how \\nto define a systematic method for identifying key warehousing design parameters?  \\nThis paper proposes a contribution to the first question only. The expected \\ncontribution is the formalisation of a number of generic design rules (means/effect) \\nusing an adapted language [7]. The expected nature of design rules is contradiction. \\nThe paper is structured as follows. Chapter 2 presents the theoretical framework. \\nChapter 3 presents the methodological framework to identify and extract generic \\ndesign rules. Chapter 4 presents an industrial application by a 3PL logistics provider. \\nFinally, chapter 5 concludes this paper and outlines research prospects. \\n2   Literature Review \\u2013 Theoretical Framework \\nA warehouse can be represented as a storage tank [9]. It has a buffer function in light \\nof the variability and uncertainty inherent in the supply chain. Its life cycle includes \\nthree major stages: design and construction; operation, development and \\nreorganisation; decommissioning or reprocessing. To consider conceptual design on a \\n5 to 10 year timeframe in terms of organisational architecture and processes, a reliable \\nvision of the demands, limitations and trends of the future warehouse is needed [4]. \\nThe strategic decision relating to warehouse evolution must take account of the \\ndynamic changes of the activities and functions, as well as the specific characteristics \\nof the system\\u2019s life cycle [10]. \\nStrategic decision-making in warehousing design is linked to the following generic \\nquestions:  \\n- \\nWhat are the achievable and unachievable performance levels?  \\n- \\nIs it necessary to modify the condition of the existing system?  \\n- \\nWhat is the effect of decision criteria on the new situation? \\n- \\nWhat are the most significant decision criteria in terms of system \\nperformance? \\n- \\nWhen decision criteria cannot be modified simultaneously, in what \\nchronological order should these criteria be modified? \\n- \\nEtc. \\nThe traditional approach in the design phase consists of inventing, creating \\npossible alternatives from which to choose. The rational decision-making model [11], \\n[12], is a 6-step process [13]: 1. define the problem; 2. identify decision criteria; 3. \\nweight the criteria; 4. develop alternatives; 5. assess alternatives (rule if criterion=\\u2026 \\nthen alternative=\\u2026); 6. choose the best alternative. This model is a sequential and \\nlogical structuring of the information to be analysed [5], [14]. The multi-criteria \\n\\nCollaborative Design of Warehousing 4.0 Using the Concept of Contradictions \\n385 \\napproaches generally undertaken [6] help select the best solution or the optimal \\nsolution from a broad range of solutions, the YES-NO type alternative being one \\nparticular case as part of a more general case. When alternatives are incompatible \\nwith the decision criteria values, a position must be taken in relation to these \\ncontradictions. \\nThis paper hypothesises that the problem solving process during the design phase \\ninvolves the identification of one or more contradictions resulting from the new \\ndecision context (e.g. market developments). Consequently, contradictions are the \\nexpression of a problem by consequences of the choices made, but obviously at least \\ntwo opposing consequences are required for a problem to arise. By expressing the \\ncause-and-effect relationships between means and performance, the contradiction \\nidentification process reveals the rules used. This helps clarify conflict areas, but also \\nand most importantly the reasons for projected technological choices. \\nTo advance the decision-making process towards a choice of technological \\nsolution, literature proposes several technological forecasting methods. Initial \\nsignificant research dates back to the early 20th century [15], [16], [17]. The primary \\npurpose of these methods is to provide a consensual view of the future technological \\nsituation [18]. A review of scientific journals, institutional reports and publications \\n[19], [20], [21] highlights methodological advances in terms of technological \\nforecasting for socio-economic and technological levels, rather than for the techno-\\nlogical level itself. The major improvements identified by the methods used to \\nforecast technological changes relate to a combination of existing techniques and \\nmodels, and the refinement of existing methods [22], [23]. The exponential increase \\nin the number of publications, institutions and researchers involved in forecasting and \\nthe development of technological forecasting methods in the past five decades has \\nyielded a multitude of techniques and methodologies [24]. \\nAfter reviewing the current practice of long-term technological forecasting \\nmethods, these methods can be classified into four categories [25]:  \\n(1) \\nphenomenological models (for example time series data extrapolations, \\nregressions),  \\n(2) \\nintuitive models (for example the Delphi method, structured and unstructured \\ninterviews),  \\n(3) \\nmonitoring and mapping (for example by reviewing the literature and sources \\npublished, scenarios, mapping of existing information), \\n(4) \\nand finally, the causal models used in this paper to analyse warehousing \\nsystem evolution rules.  \\nThe next chapter describes the method based on causal models. \\n3   Research Methodology \\nThe research-intervention method selected relies on the \\u201cResearching Future\\u201d method \\n(technological forecasting method) [26], [27]. This method combines maps of \\ncontradictions [28] with S-curves of logistics functions [29], [30]. The research \\nmethod follows the methodological triangulation principle. Triangulation is often \\n\\n386 \\nD. Kucharavy et al. \\n \\nused in management sciences. According to [31], [32], \\u201ctriangulation should support a \\nfinding by demonstrating that independent measures of it agree with or, at least, do \\nnot contradict it\\u201d. Denzin [33] highlighted three types of triangulation: the use of \\ndifferent data sources (time, space, persons); the use of different researchers; the \\nsimultaneous use of different methods. \\nTo obtain the map of contradictions, the \\u201cResearching Future\\u201d method used in this \\npaper connects the principles of the following methods: \\n- \\nthe \\u201cSystem Operator\\u201d model from the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving \\n- TRIZ [34], \\n- \\nthe \\u201cContradiction\\u201d model derived from TRIZ is developed to model \\nnetworks of problems within OTSM-TRIZ [35], \\n- \\nS-curves [30], \\n- \\ntechnology substitution models are used to measure the time and capacity of \\nevolution and substitution processes [36], [37], \\n- \\ninterpretation patterns of the knowledge obtained from the DITEK model \\n[38]. \\nThe contradiction representation language is illustrated in Fig. 1a. \\n \\n  \\nFig. 1a. Contradiction description model. \\nAn example of contradiction is described in Fig. 1b corresponding with the \\nfollowing interrogation: \\nIn the <distribution centre> system, the trend < significant flow heterogeneity> \\nencounters a barrier <storage profitability>. \\n \\n\\nCollaborative Design of Warehousing 4.0 Using the Concept of Contradictions \\n387 \\n \\nFig. 2b. Example of contradiction : handling productivity = number of (parcels or pallets)/hour; \\nstorage profitability = (storage turnover / m\\u00b2) / cost per m\\u00b2 of the storage surface area \\nThe semantics used are as follows: \\n- \\nElement \\u2013 everything (tangible or intangible) used in a combination to form a \\nwhole or a unit, \\n- \\nSystem \\u2013 group of elements interacting with each other, linked and \\ninterdependent, performing a certain function as part of a super-system. \\n- \\nTrend \\u2013 change in a system characteristic over a long period. \\n- \\nBarrier \\u2013 limitation of resources (e.g., space, time, energy), \\n- \\nParameter \\u2013 characteristic of an element which can be acted upon, \\n- \\nResult \\u2013 consequence of an action due to the value of a parameter (e.g. \\ndesired result); every indicator has a measurable value, measurement unit \\u2013 \\nstandard required to measure an indicator. \\nThe following syntax is used: \\nContradiction \\u2013 model to describe a problem through the description of a conflict \\nof interest. The contradiction model includes an element, a parameter, a parameter \\nvalue and an opposing parameter value, desired results (R1+, R2+) and unwanted \\nresults (R1-, R2-). Contradiction appears in the following case: when the evolution in \\nthe value of a parameter towards the R2+ desired leads to an unwanted R1-, and when \\nthe change in the opposing value of a parameter towards the R1+ desired leads to an \\nunwanted R2-. \\n4   Case Study \\nIntervention research is conducted in a French 3PL. Their turnover in 2016 was \\n\\u20ac2.045 billion. The scope of the study consists of 25 warehouses. Customers are \\nmainly from the agri-food, retail and healthcare industry. \\n \\n\\n388 \\nD. Kucharavy et al. \\n \\nA working group was assembled. The group includes 6 individuals, respectively 3 \\nexperts in 3PL and 3 researchers. The group had 26 meetings of 4 working hours over \\na 12-month period. The project management method is applied in generic stages:  \\n- \\nidentification of needs, \\n- \\nstudy scope specification, \\n- \\nidentification of stakeholders, \\n- \\nconsolidation of principal expert questions, \\n- \\nanalysis accuracy definition, \\n- \\nconsolidation of the expression of expected results. \\nTo define the scope of the warehousing system (WS), the primary function is \\nformulated and specified: \\u201cProvide customers with the desired quantity of products \\nwithin the desired deadline\\u201d. \\nTo comprehend significant changes in warehousing design and process, we \\ncollected chronological data on the surface area of the LP\\u2019s warehouses (m2). As the \\nbuilt-up surface and expected values are confidential information for the LP, no actual \\nfigure will be presented. The partial results of the study are presented in Fig. 2 and 3. \\nThe S-curves obtained help position the current WS in relation to its life cycle. S-\\ncurves are developed on the basis of 25 WSs spread over 13 countries. \\n \\n \\nFig. 2. Example of changes in the surface area of WSs built in France in m2  \\n(Tm=2005.5; \\u2206t=30.1; Rsquare=0.993) \\nThe increase in the surface area of existing WSs in France should stop by 2020 \\n(Fig. 2). At global level, it is estimated that saturation will be reached by 2022. New \\nwarehousing technologies should drive revenue growth without increasing the surface \\narea of WSs. \\nThe major characteristics of these new technologies are justified by the WS\\u2019s map \\nof contradictions. Every contradiction is developed based on an interrogation, trend \\nand barrier.  \\n\\nCollaborative Design of Warehousing 4.0 Using the Concept of Contradictions \\n389 \\nWhen formulating contradictions, certain interrogations were excluded from the \\nstudy as they were deemed irrelevant. Two new contradictions were identified. A \\nnumber of interrogations were aggregated and represented by the same contradictions. \\n \\n \\nFig. 3. Changes in the surface area of WSs built worldwide in m2  \\n(Tm=2008.9; \\u2206t=27.2; Rsquare=0.996) \\nAs a result of the work carried out by the working group, the outcome is \\ncharacterised by: 21 trends, 48 drivers, 49 barriers and 281 desired results. To \\nfacilitate the connection of contradictions, the 281 results are classified into six \\nindicator categories (Table 1). Fig. 4 presents a fragment of the map of the 58 \\nresulting contradictions. \\nTable 1.  Distribution of performance indicators and desired results by category.  \\nCategory \\nnumber of performance \\nindicators / category \\nnumber of desired \\nresults / category \\n1.

Flexibility \\n8 \\n19 \\nTOTAL : \\n88 \\n281 \\n \\nTo achieve a definitive description of the most significant contradictions (in terms \\nof changes in the WSs), the direct links between the contradictions formulated must \\nbe examined. This activity is under review. \\n \\n\\n390 \\nD. Kucharavy et al. \\n \\n \\nFig. 4. Extract from the map of 58 contradictions \\nThe map of contradictions represents the conflicts of interest between seven major \\nplayers (Fig. 5). The number of most significant contradictions concerns the logistics \\nprovider and the industrial producer, who are therefore the key players in the change \\nprocess. \\n \\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\n120\\nindustrial producer\\nthird-party logistics (3PL)\\nbranch warehouse\\nproduct-positioned warehouse\\ntransportation\\ndistributor\\nfinal consumer\\n \\nFig. 5. Number of connections classified by stakeholder \\n5   Discussions and Prospects \\nThe issue dealt with in this paper is as follows: \\u201cwhat are the key characteristics for \\nstrategic decision-making in terms of warehousing design?\\u201d. The result is the \\ndefinition of a map of ware-housing system contradictions. Problems are represented \\nin the form of contradictions for identifying major future WS characteristics. The \\n\\nCollaborative Design of Warehousing 4.0 Using the Concept of Contradictions \\n391 \\nresult achieved is described by a map of 58 contradictions. These contradictions are \\nobtained by linking 281 desired results (e.g. location of the ware-house) with 88 \\nperformance indicators (e.g. delivery times, etc.) classified into 6 categories (e.g. \\nlogistics cost, etc.). These contradictions concern 7 stakeholders (e.g. end user, \\ndistributor, etc.). The concept of contradiction is pertinent for initiating issues \\npertaining to the strategic evolution of WSs. \\nThe results obtained only allow for partial generalisation, as the scope of \\napplication is characterised by 25 WSs from the agri-food, retail and healthcare \\nindustry. The prospects of this study are the prioritisation of contradictions and the \\ndevelopment of a systematic method designed to identify contradictions. \\n \\nAcknowledgments.  \\nThis study was funded by FM Logistic Corporate SAS.

Since Ashton first introduced this term in 1999, dealing with the \\nintroduction of RFiD sensors in supply chain management [1], the concept has been \\nevolving representing a new paradigm in which the Internet extends into the real \\nworld embracing everyday objects [2].  \\nAt the core of the IoT there are the smart objects (SOs), which are physical things \\nenhanced by electronic devices providing them with local intelligence and \\nconnectivity to the cyberspace [3]. Local intelligence means that SOs are able to \\nsense/log/interpret what\\u2019s occurring within the surrounding environment. SOs are \\nbuilding blocks for a smart environment where different kinds of SOs continuously \\nwork to make human interactions more comfortable and safer [4]. New research \\n\\n60 S. Ammirato et al. \\ndirections argue that sensing and connection is not enough: SOs should have the \\ncapability to learn, think, and understand both physical and social worlds [5]. This \\nemerging need to empower IoT with a \\u201cbrain\\u201d for a higher level of intelligence leads \\nto a new paradigm named Cognitive Internet of Things [5]. Cognition refers to the \\nability to be aware of the environment and the human interactions, be able to learn \\nfrom the past actions and use it to make future decisions that benefit the network [6]. \\nThus a cognitive information system is able to modify its behaviour on the basis of \\nexperience, data analysis and interaction of smart and not SOs. This approach \\nchallenges the way networks and systems are designed and operate with humans. \\nCurrent industrial trends and initiatives aim to \\u201cconnect the unconnected\\u201d, changing \\nthe way people and companies act every day in many key sectors, such as \\ncommunications, health care, finance, education, transportation, manufacturing and \\nagriculture [7]. An area that is becoming \\u201ca domain of major economic and social \\ninterest for the introduction of IoT\\u201d is the security domain [8]. Security of is a cutting \\nedge issue gaining growing attention in recent years. Today, millions of connected \\ndevices are used to enhance protection levels of many types of infrastructures under \\nthe IoT paradigm [9]. \\nBank Branches (BBs) represent an interesting setting where potential benefits \\nderiving from the introduction of IoT technologies can be best exploited. In fact, a BB \\ncan be seen as a worksite where humans interact among them and smart objects to \\ncarry out multiple banking activities (operational, economic and financial). The \\npresence of such characteristics enables, in principle, the shaping of a BB as a smart \\nenvironment and its devices controlled by a cognitive information system. \\nUnfortunately, the lack of sensible efforts in improving the BB protection system \\nrepresents the main hindrance to a full transformation of a BB in a smart environment \\n[10].  \\nThis paper reports results from the BaSS (Bank Security and Safety) project, \\nfunded under the EU ERFD program, which was aimed to support banking groups to \\ndesign a Cognitive Information System able to improve: \\n\\u2022 the degree of security and safety inside the branch environment \\n\\u2022 the operational performances of security management processes \\n2   Theoretical Background \\n2.1 \\nThe BB Security Context \\nBank branches are physical spaces that, traditionally, represent the contact points \\nbetween banks and their customers. Even if the growth of on-line banking is an \\nundoubtable trend, consumers being still more likely to use on-line channels for basic \\noperations continuing to rely on bank branches for more complex financial \\ntransactions [11]. Money transactions are moving from bank counter to remote \\ncontrolled platforms which are accessible via web (Internet/mobile banking) or placed \\nclose to the branch (ATMs) [12]. At the same time, the branch\\u2019s physical layout is \\nchanging. Traditional \\u201chard\\u201d security measures as visible security cameras, armour \\nwindows and metal detectors are going to be removed from customers\\u2019 sight. \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    61 \\nAlthough such measures are important to give protection to structures and people, \\nthey can generate a bad feeling of impending danger that can persuade customers to \\navoid entering in the branch or to stay within the branch the shortest possible time. It \\nis evident that the aim to reduce the sense of anxiety in customers, is in contrast with \\nthe need to guarantee protection of people and properties against criminal attacks. \\nA criminal attack can be viewed as a sequence of actions happening in an \\ninteraction space, with the aim to obtain an unfair benefit and/or damage people or \\norganizations [13]. The following table describes the categories of illegal actions (or \\nthreats) against BBs. \\nTable 1.  Threats against BBs. \\nThreat \\nDescription \\nT1: Robbery \\nstealing from a bank while bank employees and customers are subjected to \\nforce, violence, or the threat of violence, putting the victim in fear. \\nT2: Theft \\nthe illegal taking of another's property. \\nT3: Fraud \\nis the use of potentially illegal means to obtain money, assets, or other property \\nowned or held by a bank institution. \\nT4: Damage \\nintentional or unintentional harm to somebody\\u2019s property. \\n \\nFBI and EBF reports agree that criminal attacks against BBs are a problem that \\ncontinues to take a toll on financial institutions and communities across the U.S. and \\nEurope [14] [15]. Indeed, the growing number of attacks and their high rate of success \\nprove that current protection measures are still not so efficacy and overall protection \\nsystems are far from the global security concept. \\nThe occurrence of terroristic and criminal attacks at the international level, \\nemphasized the role of security and strengthened the importance to monitor and \\ncontrol critical. \\nTo improve degree of security and safety of people and goods inside a space an \\neffective protection system is required. Conrath [16] defined protection as the set of \\nmeasures that prevent or deter attackers from accessing to physical and logical \\nresources and guidelines on how to design structures to withstand hostile acts. While \\nin the past the emphasis was primarily addressed to the security of physical assets, \\ntoday, businesses and public institution of all sizes and industries perceive a growing \\nneed to protect people and intangible assets, to preserve the continuity of their \\nbusiness processes. In this sense, new approaches in designing protection systems \\nneed to combine the security needs with those of operational freedom.  \\n2.2 Smart Environment as Cyber-Physical-Social Systems  \\nSOs are able to detect and interpret what is occurring in the surrounding environment \\n(through an embedded sensor), interacting with other SOs, exchanging information \\nwith people and perform one or more actions through an actuator [17]. The \\nintegration of SOs within physical processes, by means of computation and \\nnetworking features, shapes the so-called \\u201ccyber-physical system\\u201d (CPS) [18]. A \\nCPS, which represents the technological layer of a smart environment, is able to \\n\\n62 S. Ammirato et al. \\nacquire and apply knowledge to offer context-based services to the environment [19]. \\nA CPS integrates two main aspects: \\n\\u2022 \\na cyberspace, that refers to the generalized information resources, including \\nvirtual and digital abstractions to achieve interconnections among cyber entities; \\n\\u2022 \\nand a physical space, that refers to the real world, in which physical objects are \\nrespectively perceived and controlled by sensors and actuators to establish \\ninteractions via the communication channels, remote collaboration, real-time \\nlocalization, and autonomy maintenance [20].  \\nTwo main functional elements characterize a CPS [21]: \\n\\u2022 \\nAdvanced connectivity ensuring real-time data acquisition from the physical \\nworld and information from the cyber space; \\n\\u2022 \\nintelligent data management, analytics and computational capability that \\nconstruct the cyberspace \\nBasing on the CPS paradigm, applications have been developed to assist people \\nactivities in many domains which become smart environments: transportation and \\nlogistics [21], smart buildings [22], smart health [23], etc. \\nNew approaches tend to consider human factors as an integrant part of the CPS \\ninstead of placing them outside its boundaries. In this sense, many authors proposed \\nthe concept of Cyber-Physical-Social System (CPSS) [24] [25]. CPSS extends the \\nconcept of CPS, including the so-called \\u201csocial space\\u201d domain, featuring human \\nparticipation and interaction among humans as well as human-computer interaction. \\nHence, it is possible to characterize a CPSS as comprising the following components:  \\n\\u2022 \\nSocial Space (SS): the human space containing human actors, relationships and \\nuser\\u2019s interconnected device (Internet of People \\u2013 IoP) \\n\\u2022 \\nCyberspace (CS): the software based systems and the underlying infrastructures \\nand platforms providing services to the users (Internet of Services \\u2013 IoS) \\n\\u2022 \\nPhysical Space (PS): the physical world of interconnected SOs, including \\nsensors, actuators and gateways (Internet of Object \\u2013 IoO).  \\nWhen coupled, the above-mentioned components led to the definition of the \\nfollowing subsystems characterizing a CPSS: \\n\\u2022 \\nHuman Computer Interaction (HCI): The human is not just an operator in a smart \\nenvironment, but he/she continuously interact with SOs/devices to get \\nmobiquitous services. \\n\\u2022 \\nCyber social space (CSS): virtual worlds, social networks and internet based \\nservices allowing synchronous and asynchronous relationship among humans. \\n\\u2022 \\nCyber Physical Space (CPS): integration of software based systems, platforms, \\nnetworking infrastructures and interconnected SOs and devices providing context \\nbased services. \\nAs stated in [25], CPSS appears to be an advanced version of the IoT paradigm \\nwhere social attributes are considered to address the integration of computation, \\nnetworking and physical processes aching the interfusion of the cyber\\u2013physical space \\nand social space.  \\nFrom an operational point of view, the design of a CPSS can benefit of the recent \\nadvances in mechatronics which led to a new generation of multipurpose sensors, \\nknown as indirect or synthetic sensors [26]. According this approach, single physical \\nsensor can detect different characteristics from the same signal, instead of requiring \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    63 \\nthe use of many sensors. The ultimate embodiment of this approach would be a single \\ngeneral-purpose sensor able to digitize an entire building. This kind of sensors can be \\nattached to a variety of objects, and without modification, sense many facets [27][28]. \\nSynthetic sensors overcome traditional limitations of limited sensing functionality, \\nlimited large scale interoperability and failure to provide complex interpretations of \\nimplicit assumptions [29]. \\n3 \\nMethodology \\nWith the aim \\u201cto develop technology-based solutions to important and relevant \\nbusiness problems\\u201d, the present study follows the design research paradigm proposed \\nin [30]. As stated in [31], a design science research process can be summarized on the \\nfollowing three steps: problem identification, solution design and validation. \\nThe first step was aimed to highlight characteristics and weaknesses of the \\nprotection systems currently adopted by banking groups to protect security and safety \\nof their branches. The framework methodology we have used at this step is based on a \\nmulti-methodological development approach that include a systematic literature \\nresearch and review and interviews with experts. Literature review was intended to \\ncreate a complete understanding of the BB security domain and IoT field of study. \\nMoreover, we performed semi-structured interviews with a sample of convenience of \\nsix respondents who were working for primary Italian banking groups as security \\nmanagers at the time of the study. The data gathering for the case study has been \\ncarried out in Italy during the last three months of 2016. The interviews were based \\non pre-defined open questions dealing with organizational and technological \\ncharacteristics of the current protection systems. The second step of the methodology \\nwas aimed to propose an architecture for a cognitive protection system for BBs able to \\nmanage protection through a redesign of the BBs. In particular, we introduce a logical \\nmodel of BB under a CPSS perspective and the architecture the architecture of the \\nIntelligent Protection System \\u2013 IPS, a cognitive platform designed to manage BB \\nsecurity. Third step consisted in testing activities in order to experiment it inside a BB \\ncontext. \\n4 \\nThe Italian BB Case Study \\n4.1 The BB Protection Systems \\nMeasures to protect the BB environment can be classified according to the desired \\neffect to a criminal attack: prevention and reaction. \\nPrevention measures are static measures intended to prevent/obstacle harms to \\nbank assets discouraging the potential criminals by doing the attack. Three typologies \\nbelong to this category: traditional \\u201chard\\u201d measures (structural measures such as \\narmour windows, armed guards, armour-plated doors, time lock doors); \\u201csoft\\u201d or \\npsychological measures (i.e: transparent glasses or display panels which gives \\n\\n64 S. Ammirato et al. \\ninformation about the presence of security controls, etc.), and \\u201ctechnological\\u201d \\nmeasures used to identify and enable/hinder people entering BB environment or \\ninteracting with ATMs, (e.g., secure ID generator, credit card; biometric data) [16].  \\nReaction measures require the activation (automatic or human driven) of a \\ncountermeasure further to a risky event (i.e.: sound alarm, systems for tracing money, \\nemergency calls to law-enforcement, etc.) [32]. Traditional ways to recognize suspect \\nbehaviours comes from perimetric/volumetric sensors and from two \\u201canalogic\\u201d \\nsystems that continuously monitor the environment: the armed guards and video-\\nsurveillance system. In both cases humans, directly (the armed guards) or indirectly \\n(the security guard looking at the video streaming from the control room) present on \\nthe scene are charged to pay attention to suspect behaviours of people who could \\nattack the BB.  \\nUnfortunately, interviews agreed that security measures are characterized by low \\nefficacy and by outdated and stand-alone mechanisms. Traditional \\u201chard\\u201d security \\nmeasures clash with commercial purposes of BBs. Protection measures currently \\nadopted cannot constantly monitor the environment properly: traditional camera \\nsurveillance systems are characterized by low effectiveness due to the tiredness and \\nthe alienation of operators because of the repetitive nature of the job. Moreover, \\nprotection measures are incapable of retaining, storing and communicating data about \\ntheir state in order to examine the contexts of BB. If available, contextual information \\ncould be used to support and enhance the ability to execute specific countermeasures \\nby providing information and services tailored to the security needs.  \\n4.2 Towards a New Concept of BBs as CPSSs \\nAs emerges from interviews, the growing interest of criminals in attacking BB is \\ndirectly related to the persistent use of obsolete security technologies that, moreover, \\nare a source of organizational inefficiencies, high costs and are characterized by long \\nreaction times and scarce level of effectiveness. \\nThe transformation of a BB in a smart environment can allow, in principle, to \\novercome these critical issues, improving security process performances and \\neffectiveness against criminal attacks. In the following sections we summarize main \\ncharacteristics of a CPSS specifically designed to facilitate the rise of a smart BB. In \\nthe so-called BB CPSS, protection measures, both smart and non-SOs, are capable of \\ninteracting among them and with humans through a digital network, to improve the \\nBB security and safety management. Inside the BB CPSS, the cyber domains of \\ncommunication and computing are combined with the dynamics of physical objects \\nand their interaction with human actors proper of a BB setting [19]. After, we \\nintroduce the architecture of the IPS - Intelligent Protection System \\u2013 which is the \\ncognitive protection system designed to manage a network of BB CPSSs belonging to \\na banking group in order to improve both the degree of security and safety inside the \\nbranch environment, and the operational performances of security management \\nprocesses. \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    65 \\n4.2.1 The Logical Model of a BB CPSS \\nEach BB environment is characterized by the presence of a set of context entities, \\nintended as physical or conceptual objects which interact among them [33]. \\nAccording to Ning\\u2019s view [25], it is possible to identify the subsystems which \\ncompose the BB CPSS and, for each of them, types of context entities interact inside:  \\n\\u2022 \\nSocial Space (SS): all the human actors which interact inside a BB. Four category \\nof human entities are identified: customers, employees, attackers and guards. \\n\\u2022 \\nCyberspace (CS): the local component of the IPS, that is a software based \\nsystems able to manage the security and safety operational process which happen \\ninside a BB. \\n\\u2022 \\nPhysical Space (PS): physical SOs and non SOs involved in security and safety \\nprocesses.  \\nThe following table provide a description of the main context entities of a BB \\nmodelled as a CPSS. \\nTable 2.  Main context entities of a BB modelled as a CPSS. \\nSpace Entity \\nEntity detail \\nDescription \\nSS \\nPeople \\nP1: Customer \\na person who is utilizing one or more of the services \\nprovided by the bank. \\n \\n \\nP2: Employee \\na person who works for a bank institution under a \\ncontract of employment. \\n \\n \\nP3: Attacker \\na person who is performing a criminal action to obtain \\nan unfair benefit and to damage someone or something. \\n \\n \\nP4: Guard \\noutsourced contractor monitoring for potential threats \\nto BB, on-site (e.g. armed guard) and remotely \\n(security guard inside the control room). \\nCS \\nIPS \\n \\nA web platform based on a client-server architecture \\nable to manage security and safety process within a BB \\nPS \\nBank assets BAk \\nthe set of tangible and intangible goods that are \\nthreatened by criminal attacks. \\n \\nWeapons \\n \\nany device used with intent to inflict damage or \\nthreaten people, structures, or systems \\n \\nSafety and \\nsecurity \\nsystems \\nNon SOs \\nstatic measures intended to prevent/obstacle harms to \\nbank assets discouraging the potential criminals by \\ndoing the attack (e.g. structural measures such as \\narmour windows, armed guards, armour-plated doors, \\ntime lock doors). \\n \\n \\nSOs \\nSOs that leverage on IoT features to provide security \\nand safety services. These systems require the \\nactivation \\n(automatic \\nor \\nhuman \\ndriven) \\nof \\na \\ncountermeasure further to a risky event. Such systems \\nare based on HCI or machine-to-machine interactions \\n \\nVolpentesta et al. [34] proposed that every action performed by context entities \\ninside a smart environment affects their state. Interactions between entities can be \\nsensed, interpreted and mediated through IoT based protection systems. In certain \\ncases, a subset of actions performed by humans in a BB can be recognized as \\n\\n66 S. Ammirato et al. \\nthreatening and may trigger a sequence of security service actions (e.g. a \\ncountermeasure) involving people (attackers, customers, employees) physical goods, \\nas well safety and security systems. We define \\u201csecurity patterns\\u201d the sequence of \\nactions involving context agents within a bank branch in order to detect of a threat.  \\nIn order to model security pattern, we used the following formalism. Let us \\nconsider Sk the set of all possible statuses of a Bank Asset BAk and Ak a non-empty set \\nof actions that can be performed on BAk. We assume that any action a \\u2208 Ak, performed \\nby an actor Pi-, determines a status change (from si,k to sj,k , i\\u2260j, si,k sj,k  \\u2208 Sk) of a Bank \\nAsset BAk. Each actor Pi is allowed to perform a set of activities Ak,i, where Ak,p \\u2286 Ak. \\nThe triple BAk (Sk, Ak, P(Ak)) univocally identifies the interaction graph GBAk(N(Sk), \\nE(Ak, P(Ak))), where N(Sk) is the set of nodes, and E(Ak,p) is the set of arcs determining \\nthe transaction from a node to another, due to an action a \\u2208 Ak, performed by an actor \\nP. A dangerous situation is detected when a transaction from a node nx to ny is due to \\nan action Ak such that a \\u03f5 Ak and a \\u2209 Ak,p. A security pattern for a resource is a path p \\non the graph GBAk. Continuous interactions along the graph shape the logical model of \\nthe BB CPSS. Security patterns constitute the building blocks of a security \\ninfrastructure, in the sense that any security infrastructure comes out from a \\ncombination of some security patterns. Unlike traditional security systems, where \\nsensors are only capable of detecting simple actions in an environment (eg motion \\nsensors), the IPS allows security management procedures based on complex and \\nstructured events. For example, traditional sensors are able to sense simple events like \\n\\u201ca strongbox is open\\u201d or \\u201ca human with a metal object is crossing the BB entering \\ndoor\\u201d recognizing them as dangerous events. The IPS sensors are able to sense \\nprimary events and learn, reason, and more effectively interact with humans inside a \\nBB, leveraging on machine learning algorithms to process the data collected and \\nrecognize only real dangerous situations. Appropriate machine learning algorithms \\nenable the IPS to combine security patterns to infer secondary events. More formally, \\nlet PBAk. be the set of admissible patterns on GBAk, (i.e. a sequence of actions \\nconsidered not dangerous for BAk\\u2019s safety and security), the IPS recognizes a threat \\nwhen it identifies an interaction such that p\\u2209 PBAk . In the previous example, the IPS \\nrecognizes that strongbox is open due to authorized scheduled refilling activities (p1) \\nand the armed human is a guard already authorized to enter the BB (p2). Since both p1 \\nand p2 \\u2208 PBAk , both are \\u201cfalse positives\\u201d threats and the IPS do not activate any \\nreaction measure.  \\n4.2.2 The Architecture of the IPS \\nThe IPS is able to manage many BBs as remote controlled CPSSs in order to both \\nincrease the degree of security and safety of the branches and reduce operational and \\nmanagement costs of the banking group protection system. We defined a logical and \\ntechnological model allowing the remote management of the BB CPSSs, able to \\nhandle data coming from synthetic sensors, video surveillance (passive safety), and \\nreal-time reports from employees and sensors (active safety). The network \\narchitecture of the IPS is described below. \\n\\u2022 \\nLocal Nodes: A local node is a local protection unit of a BB charged to manage \\nand control the BB CPSS. Local nodes make use of computer vision and \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    67 \\nsynthetic sensors technologies, able to carry out the local management of the \\nsignaling, comprising the correlation with the state of other software subsystems. \\nAny local nodes interact with the central node. \\n\\u2022 \\nCentral Node: A control room that collects signals from each CPSS (local node), \\nand is able to implement prevention or reaction risk protocols [35]. The central \\nnode uses embedded technologies in order to recognize each kind of threat. \\nThe IPS is a cognitive system since it is able to recognize the types of ongoing events \\nin each BB and suggest (or automatically adopt) in real time a set of appropriate \\ncountermeasures. The IPS continuously updates and upgrades its security patterns \\nsince it is able to learn from past criminal attacks, adopted countermeasures and \\neffects of such adoption. The IPS integrates efficient models and algorithms allowing \\nthe \\\"unstructured events\\\" video surveillance, in order to minimize the number of false \\npositive alarms and to minimize the number of not identified risky situations. Smart \\ncameras can be equipped with computer vision able to recognize human behaviour.  \\nThe IPS data-processing architecture is based on a web-based multi-tier solution \\nwhich makes use of an interprocess communication mechanisms typical of enterprise-\\ntype solutions. \\n \\n \\nFig. 1. The network architecture of the IPS \\nFigure 1 shows the different components of the IPS and how information flows \\noccur from the BB CPSSs to the control room.  \\n\\u2022 \\nSensor gateway: a network device able to collect heterogeneous data from \\nsensors. \\n\\n68 S. Ammirato et al. \\n\\u2022 \\nAlert management: represent all the alarm warnings generated by the sensors \\n(break-in, intrusion, etc.) that are sent as a textual list to the control panel \\n\\u2022 \\nData Communicator: transmission communication protocol among the \\nrecognition systems (which filter the alarms by assigning them a level of danger) \\nand the platform that will display them on the control panel. This communication \\nis based on XML / RPC web services. \\n\\u2022 \\nTechnical Operator Panel: web interface for technical operators in order to \\nmanage security activities at an operational level. \\n\\u2022 \\nOperator Manager Panel: Management interface to analyse statistical data and \\nsetting up change to the security platform. \\n\\u2022 \\nDB: is the Data Base where will be saved all the events and decisions taken. \\nNaturally it contains the whole knowledge base of the system on the security \\nmeasures, security patterns and the risk model. \\nThe human interaction with security services is mediated by a ubiquitous \\ncomputing system and every smart object in the environment can potentially give \\neither an input to the IPS or an output to each person inside the smart environment. In \\nfact, the interaction is not centralized in a single device, but it involves a person, a \\npotentially huge set of smart objects distributed in the real world, and many security \\nservices running on the system. \\n5 \\nConclusions \\nSeveral authors highlighted the need for an integrated approach to managing physical \\nsecurity [36]. Physical protection systems leverage not only on technologies, but \\nintegrate people, procedures and equipment for the protection of goods or services \\nagainst theft, sabotage or any action aimed at harming people or property, implying \\nthe need for an integrated methodological approach. Physical security of people and \\nspaces (e.g. workplace, private and public areas), is becoming increasingly important, \\nand requires comprehensive and integrated solutions, characterized by ease of \\nconfiguration and immediacy of use. \\nThe availability of a new generation of multipurpose and low-cost sensors enabled \\nthe opportunity to easily redesign physical spaces as smart environments. In order to \\nexploit this opportunity, there is a need to design appropriate platforms able to \\nmanage and process data deriving from sensors. Thanks to the recent technological \\ndevelopments, it has become possible to integrate physical networks of SOs with \\ncognitive systems where applications can use such an intelligent infrastructure to \\ncarry out data analytics, process optimization and decision support. In particular, we \\npropose to deal with the traditional physical security issue of BBs under a CPSS \\nperspective. The technological infrastructure of a BB can be modelled as a CPSS \\nwhere smart and non-SOs used as protection measures, can interact among them and \\nwith humans through a digital network. Moreover, the introduction of an effective and \\ntailored Intelligent Protection System is responsible to manage an analyze data \\nacquired to synthetic sensors. \\nThe IPS we proposed combines a high level of security and safety within a bank \\nbranch to a more rapid access to the physical structure and an increased positive \\n\\nBank Branches as Smart Environments    69 \\nfeeling requested by the customers. The non-invasive sensor network designed within \\nthe platform realizes a more comfortable environment through the elimination from \\nthe customer's sight of protective elements of a crime, such as bars, revolving doors, \\ngunmen, etc., which, although currently necessary to prevent robberies, increase the \\nsense of anxiety. This is in line with the changing of commercial banking needs, \\nwhose marketing functions are pushing to let bank branches be more and more similar \\nto selling point of other industries. \\nOngoing studies are testing a prototype of the IPS in order to experiment it inside a \\nBB context. \\nReferences \\n1. \\nAshton, K.: That \\u201cinternet of things\\u201d thing.

On the other hand, our daughters may be \\nthousands of miles away from us \\u2013 and our partners either dead or on a cruise ship in \\nthe Caribbean. So we are \\u2018home alone\\u2019 \\u2013 but in contrast to the (now rather old) movie \\nhero that was 8 years old, we are 80+. Luckily, we are not totally alone as we have a \\nrobot that lives with us. The robot follows our routine and for some few days now is \\nspotting that: \\n\\u2022 \\nWe are missing meals \\n\\u2022 \\nWe are not taking any calls \\n\\u2022 \\nWe are not leaving home \\n\\u2022 \\nWe skip exercises and avoid taking our medication \\nIs it depression? Is it loneliness? Is there something that the robot should do to \\nhelp? In the European Horizons2020 MARIO project (www.mario-project.eu) we \\nhave been building Apps that would help the robot entertain persons with dementia. \\nBut we haven\\u2019t thought about reaching a higher level, namely of equipping the robot \\nwith the necessary consciousness model that will help it become a self-starter in many \\neveryday situations that a human might operate well. There is surprisingly much \\nresearch work and bibliography in the area of collaborative systems, some of which \\nalso relevant to elderly care, that can be of direct value and use in the area of human \\nrobot interaction. In this paper we aim to make clear the need for synergies between \\nthe two areas. \\n\\n396 A. Koumpis et al. \\nBy January 2018 our European research project MARIO (www.mario-project.eu) \\ncame to its end. In MARIO we introduced a humanoid care robot to help and facilitate \\ninteractions with persons with dementia \\u2013 an all in all difficult \\u2018target\\u2019 group [1]. \\nHowever, and going one level deeper in the project and its research agenda, we were \\naddressing the difficult challenges of loneliness and isolation in older persons with \\ndementia through innovative and multi-faceted inventions delivered by service robots. \\nThe effects of these conditions are severe and life-limiting. They burden individuals \\nand societal support systems. Human intervention is costly but the severity can be \\nprevented or mitigated by simple changes in self-perception and brain stimulation \\nmediated by robots. In [2] is stated that until the present, \\u2018loneliness is being treated \\nas a symptom of mental health problems; however, for elderly (aged 60 years and \\nabove), loneliness has become a disease in itself. There are epidemiological, \\nphenomenological, and etiological reasons to say that\\u2019. \\nWhat we have identified during the project lifetime and both as result of our \\nresearch activities, but also as result of our interactions with patients, their relatives \\nand the carers, is that there is well identifiable space which may have been treated as a \\nblindspot as of today and which concerns the area of modelling of human \\nconsciousness mechanisms to govern the robot. Human consciousness in our context \\nrefers both to the robot that may need to build some primitive \\u2018consciousness\\u2019 to \\nsupport its interactions with the humans in the form of empathy or affection, but also \\nfrom the side of the human user so that in case of loss of abilities due to dementia or \\nsome other reason, they will be assisted for a variety of functions and tasks. \\nThis means that while in MARIO project we mainly cared about offering \\ninterventions, there is need for some new research that will analyse human \\nconsciousness mechanisms, identify their main features, and identify the border \\nbetween human consciousness and unconsciousness to support reasoning, learning \\nand adaptation to varying emotional and behavioural patterns, conditions and \\npreferences.  \\nThe main outcome of such a research would be a software model of a robot \\nassistant that might offer functionality and features of a \\u2018virtual coach\\u2019 with an in-\\nbuilt evolution capability. At a first level, such a capability should be based on routine \\ntasks and some initial relevant physiological and behavioural data; over time it should \\nbecome more specialised to reflect the particular needs and preferences of each \\nindividual older person. \\nIn [3], the authors pose a rhetoric question, asking whether it is \\u2018possible to devise \\na general architectural principle that might lead an artificial agent to exploit what is \\ncalled consciousness in human beings and various animals?\\u2019, stating also that \\u2018in a \\nscientific and technological context, whatever formulation of consciousness one opts \\nto consider, consciousness should not come at the end of the day as an addition to an \\notherwise working description of a physical system\\u2019. For such a \\u2018working description \\nof a physical system\\u2019 it is that the authors of [4] recognize that one has to look into \\nthe construction of agent-oriented design processes, and more specifically what the \\nauthors call \\u2018the definition of the best way to create ad-hoc agent oriented design \\nprocesses\\u2019. In this respect, the development of consciousness as a multi agent system \\nwould, following the authors\\u2019 argumentation line, require \\u2018great efforts in learning \\nand using an existing design process\\u2019 and the main idea of the approach taken is one \\nhas to include in the design process also the system metamodel. \\n\\nThe Robot Who Loved Me \\n397 \\nIn [5] the author reports about the advances made in the IT industry in the area of \\nmachine reading (to avoid the term distant reading introduced by Moretti in [6] and \\nwhich has been in the last years mainly focused on the \\u2018reading\\u2019 of literature, and \\nwhat was considered as one of artificial intelligence\\u2019s holiest grails for many years. \\nWhat is interesting and relevant to our context here is a remark that one of the \\ninterviewed researchers (Ernest Davis, a New York University professor of computer \\nscience and AI researcher) provided, namely that this (: machine reading) is \\n\\u2018technically an accomplishment, but it\\u2019s not like we have to begin worshipping our \\nrobot overlords\\u2019, adding what epitomizes most successfully the point we take in our \\nresearch namely that \\u2018When you read a passage, it doesn\\u2019t come out of the clear blue \\nsky: It draws on a lot of what you know about the world\\u2019. \\n2. \\nThe Main Idea \\nThe idea of approaching real world objects through knowledge graphs automatically \\ncreated from multimodal information sources is, at least to our knowledge from the \\nliterature, uncommon. However, what might be a more uncommon idea is the case of \\nautomatically building and populating human consciousness models with the use of \\nknowledge graphs. \\nKnowledge discovery from digital big multimodal data can be done effectively by \\nemploying techniques like machine learning (such as Deep learning, SIFT), \\ndistributional semantics in NLP e.g. for text mining purposes and semantic \\naugmentation (use of domain specific formal ontologies) [7]. \\nHowever, and in order to facilitate the modeling of human consciousness, such an \\napproach can be seen as a process where studying the actual artefact (i.e. the human \\nconsciousness) is replaced by studying a latent (virtual) object consisting of a dense \\nnetwork of related information. This latent object is produced from secondary \\nsources, namely digital or digitised images and texts or other modalities, where the \\nimage or the text is used as an interface to the latent object, to which the human user \\nhas no access to.  \\nWe see a similarity with the case of an art historian studying artefacts from images \\nand catalogues or essays, or a medical doctor trying to identify pathogenies from \\nmedical images and test data. In both cases the form of information can be: \\n\\u2022 \\nstructured data (e.g. data from a collections management system records or \\nmedical test results)  \\n\\u2022 \\nunstructured text (e.g. free text description of an artefact) \\n\\u2022 \\nimages (e.g. digital or digitized images of museum objects, or CAT scans)  \\n\\u2022 \\nformalized domain knowledge existing in bibliography and in the experience \\nof the person examining the material  \\nThese sources constitute already a limiting approach to the true nature of the object \\nas such, since they constitute already \\u2018processed\\u2019 knowledge, thus eliminating facets \\nof it (e.g. same as 2D images provide us with information about the form of an object \\nfrom a certain perspective only, textual descriptions offer information only deemed \\nimportant by the author of the document, etc.).  \\n\\n398 A. Koumpis et al. \\nMoreover, the application of algorithms in these already secondary sources are \\nperceived as black boxes, thus giving the domain experts no transparent results to \\nconstruct an argumentation supporting their research. \\n3. \\nThe Need for a Collaborative Systems Perspective  \\nThere is a qualitative difference between the term need and this of a necessity; though \\nboth words are pretty close, denoting some similar condition, the difference between \\nthem lies on the prioritization, as while for a need there is an absolute demand, the \\nnecessity also relates to a craving without which a person manages to survive. \\nOur main position in this position paper is that there is a well identifiable space for \\nresearch to take place in the following years that will aim to support the field of \\nhuman-robot interaction and in particular the area of content-creation with research \\nthat will be, at a first level informed, and at a further level building on the work of \\ncollaborative systems. Work conducted and reported in [8] and [9] is of direct \\nrelevance in a variety of ways as we shall be able to indicate below, where we see a \\ngreat potential in the collaboration and the synergies for future research with the help \\nof the PRO-VE community. \\nIn [10], the authors state that \\u2018in order to have a robotic system able to effectively \\nlearn by imitation, and not merely reproduce the movements of a human teacher, the \\nsystem should have the capabilities of deeply understanding the perceived actions to \\nbe imitated\\u2019. In our context, we need to combine all existing knowledge patterns and \\ninformation sources that may be considered as relevant to a situation that our MARIO \\nrobot may encounter, while also relate them or, if more appropriately, match them \\nwith a situation that the robot may have just or recently encountered with a human \\nuser, like this of holding a conversation on a family matter (planning for the visit of a \\nrelative or need to have some medical tests). To this aim we take a holistic approach \\nthat combines bottom-up and top-down approach. In particular: \\n\\u2022 \\nbottom-up approach that is based on the employment of Big Data analytics \\ntechniques to explore what may in the future constitute some potentially relevant \\npatterns by having access to a vast pool of online media resources like social \\nmedia, internet discussion forums, blogs, etc. that are relevant to the discussion \\ntopic between the human and the robot, as well as a \\n\\u2022 \\ntop-down approach that takes as starting points existing patterns or instances of \\npast interactions between the robot and the human in the recent past, and check \\nfor their relevance. \\nAs one may expect, the superiority and the longer term sustainability and value of \\nour approach relates to the combination of both bottom-up and top-down approaches. \\nOnly the top-down would result into yet another \\u2018spell-checker\\u2019; only the bottom-up \\nwould result into an endless crawling of the Web where patterns might be ignored \\neven if they would exist because they couldn\\u2019t be identified using the current \\ninformation. Same as in crime forensics where DNA profiling may have been used \\nafter several years to identify individuals by characteristics of their DNA, our tools \\nshall offer the capability to store patterns that will be identified after some time, when \\nsome increased information will have been collected. This is an important feature of \\nour approach. \\n\\nThe Robot Who Loved Me \\n399 \\nFurther to this, complementary and potentially relevant patterns will be identified \\nby means of algorithms in statistical analysis and machine learning for sentiment \\nextraction and social network analysis (Bottom-Up-Approach). In particular, this \\napproach has the potential to uncover hitherto unknown patterns in the source data \\nand therefore enable the construction of new hate speech categories related to a \\nspecific field and knowledge base. The outcomes of both approaches will be united in \\na consistent, unified formal knowledge representation, to allow both for an extended \\nand improved understanding of the subjects of investigation and for a long-term, \\nversatile reusability of the collected data. At our group we have developed data-driven \\nmethods for data-driven decision making, recommendation and contextual suggestion \\nengines, using and/or developing algorithms for classification, clustering, rule \\nextraction and sentiment analysis. \\nTo the above one may find an instance of the problem of origins and first cause or \\nwhat we usually call as a chicken and egg situation. We have been all educated to use \\nin relational data and database modeling as this has been typically the prevailing \\nparadigm that was also driven by the structure of available data for many years now. \\nThe key question that has been driving the development, the research and the business \\nthere and is also used as the main design theme is: \\u201cWhat answers do I have?\\u201d \\nHowever, today\\u2019s problems and challenges as well as modern data and database \\nmodeling (what is also usually called as \\u2018NoSQL\\u2019) is typically driven by application-\\nspecific access patterns, i.e. the types of queries to be supported. So the main question \\nand also the main design theme here is: \\u201cWhat questions do I have?\\u201d \\nIt is for this reason that collaborative systems are relevant and highly necessary to \\nconsider as an enabling technology for all future developments in the areas of \\nintelligent systems and in particular for the area of human robot interaction.  \\nOne should be able to intuitively see the difference and also the parallels we see \\nwith the modelling of human consciousness. As an example we can imagine a library \\nwith all sorts of books \\u2013 the books that a person may have read in their lives. We are \\nall aware of the Dewey system \\u2013 or as it is properly called: the Dewey Decimal \\nClassification. This is an ideal role model example on why people came up with the \\nconcept and the idea of relational databases. And, by the way, this is a system that \\nstarted being shaped back in the 1870s. \\nHowever, if one imagines that our driver is not to find: \\n\\u2022 \\nif a book exists in our library or  \\n\\u2022 \\nwho has borrowed it,  \\n\\u2022 \\nwho is the publisher,  \\n\\u2022 \\nwhen it was published or  \\n\\u2022 \\nother similar \\u2018relational\\u2019 questions,  \\nbut: \\n\\u2022 \\nanything about the contents of the books,  \\n\\u2022 \\nanything that might be unexpected, unplannable, impossible or even at some \\npoint to consider as unworthy to even model when building our \\u2018neat and \\ncute\\u2019 relational database reality,  \\nit is in this case, where we don\\u2019t know which possible questions we have, where the \\nneed for adopting a collaborative systems approach comes on stage.  \\n\\n400 A. Koumpis et al. \\nThere is always a risk with the quality of the information acquired from unknown \\nsources \\u2013 a good example for this relates with the case of fake news. If the \\nconsciousness model for our case relies on any type of lesser value content such as the \\ncase of fake news, it is obvious that this will affect the quality of the model as such. \\nTo this problem, however, we can take a similar stand to the one we take in real life: \\nnot all people build their consciousness on the same sources or may be able to exhibit \\nsome evidence-based consistency in the way their consciousness models are built. But \\nit is therefore that a CN-based approach would increase the value of the end system, \\nas the aggregate results of such a consciousness model that comes as outcome of the \\ncollaboration amongst can will tend to be more accurate than any single entity alone. \\nThis collaboration aspect should be not mistakenly related to with crowdsourcing that \\nis rather the process where knowledge is obtained from the public at large through a \\nsystem of invitations and incentives [12, 13]. \\n3.1. \\nA Word on Ethics \\nThe ethics work during the MARIO project provided an innovative, integrated \\napproach to addressing ethical issues in robot design, research and implementation, \\naddressing the entire development process of the project [11]. As developed within \\nthe project lifetime, the ethics framework we developed provided a new \\ncomprehensive review of relevant interdisciplinary literature with relevance for \\nunderstanding ethical concerns regarding the use of care robots, a useful contribution \\nto the field of the ethics of care robots. In addition, its findings informed the approach \\nto data management in the project.  \\nOn the basis of the MARIO ethics framework, a set of innovative practical tools in \\nthe form of five ethics checklists were developed to guide ethical practice for different \\nstakeholders in robot development, research and implementation. These were tested \\nby different stakeholders, who found them to be helpful practical tools for their \\nrespective practice areas. An \\u201cethical encountered issues\\u201d form was employed during \\nthe pilots, to capture evidence on the incidence of actual ethical issues that \\nstakeholders encountered during trials. These indicated that careful implementation \\nwas required, but that users generally tolerated the robot well and distress was rare. \\nThese tools have the potential to be employed in different care robot projects, and \\nthe ethics tools and experiences from the project will be published to make them \\navailable to the international robot community, contributing to the development of a \\nsolid evidence base of ethical concerns in care robotics, which, if those results remain \\nas positive as during the MARIO project, is likely to facilitate wider societal \\nacceptance of the use of care robots in the care setting. It is interesting in this context \\nto take into account that in [14] the authors identify in relation to service robots a \\nproblem related, amongst others, with loss of control from the side of the elderly \\nperson due to robot monitoring and the interventions that the latter undertake within \\ntheir daily activities and routine. This is true at a great extent, and same as the (feeling \\nof a) loss of privacy and the (feeling of) infantilisation. However, one has to admit \\nthat the benefits of such a technology equal out at a great extent all potential \\ndrawbacks. \\n\\nThe Robot Who Loved Me \\n401 \\n4. \\nConclusions \\nDevelopments in the addressed area of modeling human consciousness in computable \\nand computer-processable forms are still in a fluid form. This poses a challenge for \\nbringing together a corpus of research that has taken and is still taking place in the \\narea of collaborative systems to identify and, if possible, also seize challenges that \\nwill change the way we perceive our idea for the use of robots in everyday tasks. The \\nresult of a robot intelligence will not anymore rely on its \\u2018hardwired\\u2019 intelligence but, \\nwith use of sentiment analysis and deep learning technologies, their capabilities to \\nextract information from a variety of modalities and media including videos, images, \\nnatural language, as well as structured data and then automatically transform them \\ninto \\u2018actionable information\\u2019 by means of deploying them in their interactions with \\nthe human users.  \\nIt is worth to mention here that in the MARIO project, as well as in the context of \\nthe present paper, we refer to robots that act as an extension of humans offering to \\nthem a symbiotic perspective, so these are not what one would consider as \\u2018truly \\nautonomous robots\\u2019. However, the aim to model aspects of the human consciousness \\nis dual namely on the one hand to replicate it in robots, while on the other hand to \\nhelp robots extend and complement the consciousness of people with decaying \\ncognitive ability. \\nFrom our research expertise it is evident that we promote the idea of exploiting \\ndevelopments in the areas of semantic technologies and statistical based natural \\nlanguage processing to facilitate the task of building data-driven models of body \\nconsciousness that will be possible to be easily populated with big data acquired from \\na variety of sources. Furthermore, we are able to see that the improvements to be \\nmade will seriously lag behind the needs that exist if our research shall not be \\ninformed and enriched with the perspective taken in the area of collaborative systems. \\nHuman intelligence is in all its aspects and manifestations such a system, \\nconsisting of a variety of entities and artifacts, demonstrating also characteristics of \\nautonomy as well as synergy, geography is also of importance with the ability to take \\nadvantage of geographical distribution as well as of geographical concentration, while \\nlast but not least, heterogeneity is also a key term as it affects all levels like the \\nculture, the socio-economic context, or even the daily (operational) routines. \\nIt may seem like a novelty to think of a future with networks of collaborating \\nrobots that are working together to offer a service to an individual. However, and \\nwhile from a technology stance this may be a novelty, from an organizational point \\nthis is not at all: currently, and for the care to an old person, there may be their \\nchildren that will interact with the physicians and the nurses. In the future, all these \\ninteractions may take place in an automated fashion by robots that will live with us \\nsame as the MARIO robot does with the persons with dementia. \\nAcknowledgements \\nThis work was supported in part by a grant from the European Union Horizons 2020 \\u2013 \\nthe Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014\\u20132020) under grant \\n\\n402 A.

The general context of this paper is the strategic planning of \\ndistribution centre warehouses. The idea is to anticipate changes in the \\nwarehouse based on objectives and issues generally linked to market (e.g.: \\nelectronic trade, etc.) and environmental developments (e.g.: last-mile logistics, \\netc.). Planning requires overcoming the consequences of the choices made as \\nwell as their interactions. To inform and justify projected technological choices, \\nit is crucial to identify and understand design rules which are often \\ncontradictory. Problems arise out of contradictions! To support strategic \\nplanning, the decision-making aid proposed in this paper consists of extracting \\nand formalising all problems in the form of contradictory design rules.  \\nKeywords: Warehousing systems, Strategic planning, Technology forecasting, \\nEvolution of warehousing, Cartography of contradictions. \\n1   Introduction \\nTo a large extent, the logistics costs of warehouses are determined during the design \\nphase [1]. As a general rule, based on a functional description, the warehouse design \\nphase consists of choosing a layout and associated technologies of the four core \\nactivities (receiving, storage, order picking and shipping), as well as a planning mode \\nfor the operations related to these activities [2], [3]. Changes in this functional \\ndescription are primarily correlated with the rapidly evolving market [4]. The \\nemergence of new consumption patterns, such as e-commerce for example, is likely to \\nimpose the introduction of new dedicated storage technologies, involving substantial \\ninvestment and high financial risks to boot.  \\nAs a result, it is imperative to plan and control the strategic evolution of logistic \\nwarehouses. Strategic planning decisions, generally characterised by a 10 to 15 year \\ntimeframe, relate to the determination of the general policies and plans for the use of \\nthe resources of the future warehouse [5]. \\nIn some cases, these evolutions can be promptly addressed via planned decisions; \\nthe activities associated with the decision are execution activities [6]. Conversely, \\nwhen there are no decisions relating to the new situation, a problem solving activity is \\nrequired. These unscheduled decisions are more difficult to examine as they involve a \\n\\n384 \\nD. Kucharavy et al. \\n \\nwide-ranging body of knowledge (endogenous and exogenous to the warehouse). This \\nbody of knowledge is often contradictory. \\nResearch projects undertaken in warehousing design primarily focus on \\nendogenous warehousing parameters [7], [8]. Few projects simultaneously factor in \\nendogenous and exogenous parameters. The warehouse of the future depends on \\nenvironmental developments. Market demands, limitations and trends bring about \\noperational, technological and organisational innovations and changes [4]. This \\ncontext raises two research questions. First question: what are the key characteristics \\nfor strategic decision-making in terms of warehousing design? Second question: how \\nto define a systematic method for identifying key warehousing design parameters?  \\nThis paper proposes a contribution to the first question only. The expected \\ncontribution is the formalisation of a number of generic design rules (means/effect) \\nusing an adapted language [7]. The expected nature of design rules is contradiction. \\nThe paper is structured as follows. Chapter 2 presents the theoretical framework. \\nChapter 3 presents the methodological framework to identify and extract generic \\ndesign rules. Chapter 4 presents an industrial application by a 3PL logistics provider. \\nFinally, chapter 5 concludes this paper and outlines research prospects. \\n2   Literature Review \\u2013 Theoretical Framework \\nA warehouse can be represented as a storage tank [9]. It has a buffer function in light \\nof the variability and uncertainty inherent in the supply chain. Its life cycle includes \\nthree major stages: design and construction; operation, development and \\nreorganisation; decommissioning or reprocessing. To consider conceptual design on a \\n5 to 10 year timeframe in terms of organisational architecture and processes, a reliable \\nvision of the demands, limitations and trends of the future warehouse is needed [4]. \\nThe strategic decision relating to warehouse evolution must take account of the \\ndynamic changes of the activities and functions, as well as the specific characteristics \\nof the system\\u2019s life cycle [10]. \\nStrategic decision-making in warehousing design is linked to the following generic \\nquestions:  \\n- \\nWhat are the achievable and unachievable performance levels?  \\n- \\nIs it necessary to modify the condition of the existing system?  \\n- \\nWhat is the effect of decision criteria on the new situation? \\n- \\nWhat are the most significant decision criteria in terms of system \\nperformance? \\n- \\nWhen decision criteria cannot be modified simultaneously, in what \\nchronological order should these criteria be modified? \\n- \\nEtc. \\nThe traditional approach in the design phase consists of inventing, creating \\npossible alternatives from which to choose. The rational decision-making model [11], \\n[12], is a 6-step process [13]: 1. define the problem; 2. identify decision criteria; 3. \\nweight the criteria; 4. develop alternatives; 5. assess alternatives (rule if criterion=\\u2026 \\nthen alternative=\\u2026); 6. choose the best alternative. This model is a sequential and \\nlogical structuring of the information to be analysed [5], [14]. The multi-criteria \\n\\nCollaborative Design of Warehousing 4.0 Using the Concept of Contradictions \\n385 \\napproaches generally undertaken [6] help select the best solution or the optimal \\nsolution from a broad range of solutions, the YES-NO type alternative being one \\nparticular case as part of a more general case. When alternatives are incompatible \\nwith the decision criteria values, a position must be taken in relation to these \\ncontradictions. \\nThis paper hypothesises that the problem solving process during the design phase \\ninvolves the identification of one or more contradictions resulting from the new \\ndecision context (e.g. market developments). Consequently, contradictions are the \\nexpression of a problem by consequences of the choices made, but obviously at least \\ntwo opposing consequences are required for a problem to arise. By expressing the \\ncause-and-effect relationships between means and performance, the contradiction \\nidentification process reveals the rules used. This helps clarify conflict areas, but also \\nand most importantly the reasons for projected technological choices. \\nTo advance the decision-making process towards a choice of technological \\nsolution, literature proposes several technological forecasting methods. Initial \\nsignificant research dates back to the early 20th century [15], [16], [17]. The primary \\npurpose of these methods is to provide a consensual view of the future technological \\nsituation [18]. A review of scientific journals, institutional reports and publications \\n[19], [20], [21] highlights methodological advances in terms of technological \\nforecasting for socio-economic and technological levels, rather than for the techno-\\nlogical level itself. The major improvements identified by the methods used to \\nforecast technological changes relate to a combination of existing techniques and \\nmodels, and the refinement of existing methods [22], [23]. The exponential increase \\nin the number of publications, institutions and researchers involved in forecasting and \\nthe development of technological forecasting methods in the past five decades has \\nyielded a multitude of techniques and methodologies [24]. \\nAfter reviewing the current practice of long-term technological forecasting \\nmethods, these methods can be classified into four categories [25]:  \\n(1) \\nphenomenological models (for example time series data extrapolations, \\nregressions),  \\n(2) \\nintuitive models (for example the Delphi method, structured and unstructured \\ninterviews),  \\n(3) \\nmonitoring and mapping (for example by reviewing the literature and sources \\npublished, scenarios, mapping of existing information), \\n(4) \\nand finally, the causal models used in this paper to analyse warehousing \\nsystem evolution rules.  \\nThe next chapter describes the method based on causal models. \\n3   Research Methodology \\nThe research-intervention method selected relies on the \\u201cResearching Future\\u201d method \\n(technological forecasting method) [26], [27]. This method combines maps of \\ncontradictions [28] with S-curves of logistics functions [29], [30]. The research \\nmethod follows the methodological triangulation principle. Triangulation is often \\n\\n386 \\nD. Kucharavy et al. \\n \\nused in management sciences. According to [31], [32], \\u201ctriangulation should support a \\nfinding by demonstrating that independent measures of it agree with or, at least, do \\nnot contradict it\\u201d. Denzin [33] highlighted three types of triangulation: the use of \\ndifferent data sources (time, space, persons); the use of different researchers; the \\nsimultaneous use of different methods. \\nTo obtain the map of contradictions, the \\u201cResearching Future\\u201d method used in this \\npaper connects the principles of the following methods: \\n- \\nthe \\u201cSystem Operator\\u201d model from the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving \\n- TRIZ [34], \\n- \\nthe \\u201cContradiction\\u201d model derived from TRIZ is developed to model \\nnetworks of problems within OTSM-TRIZ [35], \\n- \\nS-curves [30], \\n- \\ntechnology substitution models are used to measure the time and capacity of \\nevolution and substitution processes [36], [37], \\n- \\ninterpretation patterns of the knowledge obtained from the DITEK model \\n[38]. \\nThe contradiction representation language is illustrated in Fig. 1a. \\n \\n  \\nFig. 1a. Contradiction description model. \\nAn example of contradiction is described in Fig. 1b corresponding with the \\nfollowing interrogation: \\nIn the <distribution centre> system, the trend < significant flow heterogeneity> \\nencounters a barrier <storage profitability>. \\n \\n\\nCollaborative Design of Warehousing 4.0 Using the Concept of Contradictions \\n387 \\n \\nFig. 2b. Example of contradiction : handling productivity = number of (parcels or pallets)/hour; \\nstorage profitability = (storage turnover / m\\u00b2) / cost per m\\u00b2 of the storage surface area \\nThe semantics used are as follows: \\n- \\nElement \\u2013 everything (tangible or intangible) used in a combination to form a \\nwhole or a unit, \\n- \\nSystem \\u2013 group of elements interacting with each other, linked and \\ninterdependent, performing a certain function as part of a super-system. \\n- \\nTrend \\u2013 change in a system characteristic over a long period. \\n- \\nBarrier \\u2013 limitation of resources (e.g., space, time, energy), \\n- \\nParameter \\u2013 characteristic of an element which can be acted upon, \\n- \\nResult \\u2013 consequence of an action due to the value of a parameter (e.g. \\ndesired result); every indicator has a measurable value, measurement unit \\u2013 \\nstandard required to measure an indicator. \\nThe following syntax is used: \\nContradiction \\u2013 model to describe a problem through the description of a conflict \\nof interest. The contradiction model includes an element, a parameter, a parameter \\nvalue and an opposing parameter value, desired results (R1+, R2+) and unwanted \\nresults (R1-, R2-). Contradiction appears in the following case: when the evolution in \\nthe value of a parameter towards the R2+ desired leads to an unwanted R1-, and when \\nthe change in the opposing value of a parameter towards the R1+ desired leads to an \\nunwanted R2-. \\n4   Case Study \\nIntervention research is conducted in a French 3PL. Their turnover in 2016 was \\n\\u20ac2.045 billion. The scope of the study consists of 25 warehouses. Customers are \\nmainly from the agri-food, retail and healthcare industry. \\n \\n\\n388 \\nD. Kucharavy et al. \\n \\nA working group was assembled. The group includes 6 individuals, respectively 3 \\nexperts in 3PL and 3 researchers. The group had 26 meetings of 4 working hours over \\na 12-month period. The project management method is applied in generic stages:  \\n- \\nidentification of needs, \\n- \\nstudy scope specification, \\n- \\nidentification of stakeholders, \\n- \\nconsolidation of principal expert questions, \\n- \\nanalysis accuracy definition, \\n- \\nconsolidation of the expression of expected results. \\nTo define the scope of the warehousing system (WS), the primary function is \\nformulated and specified: \\u201cProvide customers with the desired quantity of products \\nwithin the desired deadline\\u201d. \\nTo comprehend significant changes in warehousing design and process, we \\ncollected chronological data on the surface area of the LP\\u2019s warehouses (m2). As the \\nbuilt-up surface and expected values are confidential information for the LP, no actual \\nfigure will be presented. The partial results of the study are presented in Fig. 2 and 3. \\nThe S-curves obtained help position the current WS in relation to its life cycle. S-\\ncurves are developed on the basis of 25 WSs spread over 13 countries. \\n \\n \\nFig. 2. Example of changes in the surface area of WSs built in France in m2  \\n(Tm=2005.5; \\u2206t=30.1; Rsquare=0.993) \\nThe increase in the surface area of existing WSs in France should stop by 2020 \\n(Fig. 2). At global level, it is estimated that saturation will be reached by 2022. New \\nwarehousing technologies should drive revenue growth without increasing the surface \\narea of WSs. \\nThe major characteristics of these new technologies are justified by the WS\\u2019s map \\nof contradictions. Every contradiction is developed based on an interrogation, trend \\nand barrier.  \\n\\nCollaborative Design of Warehousing 4.0 Using the Concept of Contradictions \\n389 \\nWhen formulating contradictions, certain interrogations were excluded from the \\nstudy as they were deemed irrelevant. Two new contradictions were identified. A \\nnumber of interrogations were aggregated and represented by the same contradictions. \\n \\n \\nFig. 3. Changes in the surface area of WSs built worldwide in m2  \\n(Tm=2008.9; \\u2206t=27.2; Rsquare=0.996) \\nAs a result of the work carried out by the working group, the outcome is \\ncharacterised by: 21 trends, 48 drivers, 49 barriers and 281 desired results. To \\nfacilitate the connection of contradictions, the 281 results are classified into six \\nindicator categories (Table 1). Fig. 4 presents a fragment of the map of the 58 \\nresulting contradictions. \\nTable 1.

This activity is under review. \\n \\n\\n390 \\nD. Kucharavy et al. \\n \\n \\nFig. 4. Extract from the map of 58 contradictions \\nThe map of contradictions represents the conflicts of interest between seven major \\nplayers (Fig. 5).

The result is the \\ndefinition of a map of ware-housing system contradictions. Problems are represented \\nin the form of contradictions for identifying major future WS characteristics. The \\n\\nCollaborative Design of Warehousing 4.0 Using the Concept of Contradictions \\n391 \\nresult achieved is described by a map of 58 contradictions. These contradictions are \\nobtained by linking 281 desired results (e.g. location of the ware-house) with 88 \\nperformance indicators (e.g. delivery times, etc.) classified into 6 categories (e.g. \\nlogistics cost, etc.). These contradictions concern 7 stakeholders (e.g. end user, \\ndistributor, etc.). The concept of contradiction is pertinent for initiating issues \\npertaining to the strategic evolution of WSs. \\nThe results obtained only allow for partial generalisation, as the scope of \\napplication is characterised by 25 WSs from the agri-food, retail and healthcare \\nindustry. The prospects of this study are the prioritisation of contradictions and the \\ndevelopment of a systematic method designed to identify contradictions. \\n \\nAcknowledgments.  \\nThis study was funded by FM Logistic Corporate SAS.

people \\nthey can generate a bad feeling of impending danger that can persuade customers to \\navoid entering in the branch or to stay within the branch the shortest possible time it \\nis evident that the aim to reduce the sense of anxiety in customers is in contrast with \\nthe need to guarantee protection of people and properties against criminal attacks \\na criminal attack can be viewed as a sequence of actions happening in an \\ninteraction space with the aim to obtain an unfair benefit andor damage people or \\norganizations  the following table describes the categories of illegal

\\ncontinues to take a toll on financial institutions and communities across the us and \\neurope   indeed the growing number of attacks and their high rate of success \\nprove that current protection measures are still not so efficacy and overall protection \\nsystems are far from the global security concept \\nthe occurrence of terroristic and criminal attacks at the international level

predefined open questions dealing with organizational and technological \\ncharacteristics of the current protection systems the second step of the methodology \\nwas aimed to propose an architecture for a cognitive protection system for bbs able to \\nmanage protection through a redesign of the bbs in particular we introduce a logical \\nmodel of bb under a cpss perspective and the architecture the architecture of the \\nintelligent protection system  ips a cognitive platform designed to manage bb \\nsecurity third step consisted in testing activities in order to experiment it inside a bb \\ncontext \\n \\nthe italian bb case study \\n the bb protection systems \\nmeasures to protect the bb environment can be classified according to the desired \\neffect to a criminal attack prevention and reaction \\nprevention measures are static measures intended to preventobstacle harms to \\nbank assets discouraging the potential criminals by doing the attack three typologies \\nbelong to this category traditional hard measures structural measures such as \\narmour windows armed guards armourplated doors time lock doors soft or \\npsychological measures ie transparent glasses or display panels which gives \\n\\n s ammirato et al \\ninformation about the presence of security controls etc and technological \\nmeasures used to identify and enablehinder people entering bb environment or \\ninteracting with atms eg secure id generator credit card biometric data   \\nreaction measures require the activation automatic or human driven of a \\ncountermeasure further to a risky event ie sound alarm systems for tracing money \\nemergency calls to lawenforcement etc  traditional ways to recognize suspect \\nbehaviours comes from perimetricvolumetric sensors and from two analogic \\nsystems that continuously monitor the environment the armed guards and video\\nsurveillance system in both cases humans directly the armed guards or indirectly \\nthe security guard looking at the video streaming from the control room present on \\nthe scene are charged to pay attention to suspect behaviours of people who could \\nattack the bb  \\nunfortunately interviews agreed that security measures are characterized by low \\nefficacy and by outdated and standalone mechanisms traditional hard security \\nmeasures clash with commercial purposes of bbs protection measures currently \\nadopted cannot constantly monitor the environment properly traditional camera \\nsurveillance systems are characterized by low effectiveness due to the tiredness and \\nthe alienation of operators because of the repetitive nature of the job moreover \\nprotection measures are incapable of retaining storing and communicating data about \\ntheir state in order to examine the contexts of bb if available contextual information \\ncould be used to support and enhance the ability to execute specific countermeasures \\nby providing information and services tailored to the security needs  \\n towards a new concept of bbs as cpsss \\nas emerges from interviews the growing interest of criminals in attacking bb is \\ndirectly related to the persistent use of obsolete security technologies that moreover \\nare a source of organizational inefficiencies high costs and are characterized by long \\nreaction times and scarce level of effectiveness \\nthe transformation of a bb in a smart environment can allow in principle to \\novercome these critical issues improving security process performances and \\neffectiveness against criminal attacks in the following sections we summarize main \\ncharacteristics of a cpss specifically designed to facilitate the rise of a smart bb in \\nthe socalled bb cpss protection measures both smart and nonsos are capable of \\ninteracting among them and with humans through a digital network to improve the \\nbb security and safety management inside the bb cpss the cyber domains of \\ncommunication and computing are combined with the dynamics of physical objects \\nand their interaction with human actors proper of a bb setting  after we \\nintroduce the architecture of the ips  intelligent protection system  which is the \\ncognitive protection system designed to manage a network of bb cpsss belonging to \\na banking group in order to improve both the degree of security and safety inside the \\nbranch environment and the operational performances of security management \\nprocesses \\n\\nbank branches as smart environments     \\n the logical model of a bb cpss \\neach bb environment is characterized by the presence of a set of context entities \\nintended as physical or conceptual objects which interact among them  \\naccording to nings view  it is possible to identify the subsystems which \\ncompose the bb cpss and for each of them types of context entities interact inside  \\n \\nsocial space ss all the human actors which interact inside a bb four category \\nof human entities are identified customers

proposed that every action performed by context entities \\ninside a smart environment affects their state interactions between entities can be \\nsensed interpreted and mediated through iot based protection systems in certain \\ncases a subset of actions performed by humans in a bb can be recognized as \\n\\n s ammirato et al \\nthreatening and may trigger a sequence of security service actions eg a \\ncountermeasure involving people attackers customers employees physical goods \\nas well safety and security systems we define security patterns the sequence of \\nactions involving context agents within a bank branch in order to detect of a threat  \\nin order to model security pattern we used the following formalism let us \\nconsider sk the set of all possible statuses of a bank asset bak and ak a nonempty set \\nof actions that can be performed on bak we assume that any action a  ak performed \\nby an actor pi determines a status change from sik to sjk  ij sik sjk   sk of a bank \\nasset bak each actor pi is allowed to perform a set of activities aki where akp  ak \\nthe triple bak sk ak pak univocally identifies the interaction graph gbaknsk \\neak pak where nsk is the set of nodes and eakp is the set of arcs determining \\nthe transaction from a node to another due to an action a  ak performed by an actor \\np a dangerous situation is detected when a transaction from a node nx to ny is due to \\nan action ak such that a \\u03f5 ak and a  akp a security pattern for a resource is a path p \\non the graph gbak continuous interactions along the graph shape the logical model of \\nthe bb cpss security patterns constitute the building blocks of a security \\ninfrastructure in the sense that any security infrastructure comes out from a \\ncombination of some security patterns unlike traditional security systems where \\nsensors are only capable of detecting simple actions in an environment eg motion \\nsensors the ips allows security management procedures based on complex and \\nstructured events for example traditional sensors are able to sense simple events like \\na strongbox is open or a human with a metal object is crossing the bb entering \\ndoor recognizing them as dangerous events the ips sensors are able to sense \\nprimary events and learn reason and more effectively interact with humans inside a \\nbb leveraging on machine learning algorithms to process the data collected and \\nrecognize only real dangerous situations appropriate machine learning algorithms \\nenable the ips to combine security patterns to infer secondary events more formally \\nlet pbak be the set of admissible patterns on gbak ie a sequence of actions \\nconsidered not dangerous for baks safety and security the ips recognizes a threat \\nwhen it identifies an interaction such that p pbak  in the previous example the ips \\nrecognizes that strongbox is open due to authorized scheduled refilling activities p \\nand the armed human is a guard already authorized to enter the bb p since both p \\nand p  pbak  both are false positives threats and the ips do not activate any \\nreaction measure  \\n the architecture of the ips \\nthe ips is able to manage many bbs as remote controlled cpsss in order to both \\nincrease the degree of security and safety of the branches and reduce operational and \\nmanagement costs of the banking group protection system we defined a logical and \\ntechnological model allowing the remote management of the bb cpsss able to \\nhandle data coming from synthetic sensors video surveillance passive safety and \\nrealtime reports from employees and sensors active safety the network \\narchitecture of the ips is described below \\n \\nlocal nodes a local node is a local protection unit of a bb charged to manage \\nand control the bb cpss local nodes make use of computer vision and \\n\\nbank branches as smart environments     \\nsynthetic sensors technologies able to carry out the local management of the \\nsignaling comprising the correlation with the state of other software subsystems \\nany local nodes interact with the central node \\n \\ncentral node a control room that collects signals from each cpss local node \\nand is able to implement prevention or reaction risk protocols  the central \\nnode uses embedded technologies in order to recognize each kind of threat \\nthe ips is a cognitive system since it is able to recognize the types of ongoing events \\nin each bb and suggest or automatically adopt in real time a set of appropriate \\ncountermeasures the ips continuously updates and upgrades its security patterns \\nsince it is able to learn from past criminal attacks adopted countermeasures and \\neffects of such adoption the ips integrates efficient models and algorithms allowing \\nthe unstructured events video surveillance in order to minimize the number of false \\npositive alarms and to minimize the number of not identified risky situations smart \\ncameras can be equipped with computer vision able to recognize human behaviour  \\nthe ips dataprocessing architecture is based on a webbased multitier solution \\nwhich makes use of an interprocess communication mechanisms typical of enterprise\\ntype solutions \\n \\n \\nfig  the network architecture of the ips \\nfigure  shows the different components of the ips and how information flows \\noccur from the bb cpsss to the control room  \\n \\nsensor gateway a network device able to collect heterogeneous data from \\nsensors \\n\\n s ammirato et al \\n \\nalert

interface to analyse statistical data and \\nsetting up change to the security platform \\n \\ndb is the data base where will be saved all the events and decisions taken \\nnaturally it contains the whole knowledge base of the system on the security \\nmeasures security patterns and the risk model \\nthe human interaction with security services is mediated by a ubiquitous \\ncomputing system and every smart object in the environment can potentially give \\neither an input to the ips or an output to each person inside the smart environment in \\nfact the interaction is not centralized in a single device but it involves a person a \\npotentially huge set of smart objects distributed in the real world and many security \\nservices running on the system \\n \\nconclusions \\nseveral authors highlighted the need for an integrated approach to managing physical \\nsecurity  physical protection systems leverage not only on technologies but \\nintegrate people procedures and equipment for the protection of goods or services \\nagainst theft sabotage or any action aimed at harming people or property implying \\nthe need for an integrated methodological approach physical security of people and \\nspaces eg workplace private and public areas is becoming increasingly important \\nand requires comprehensive and integrated solutions characterized by ease of \\nconfiguration and immediacy of use \\nthe availability of a new generation of multipurpose and lowcost sensors enabled \\nthe opportunity to easily redesign physical spaces as smart environments in order to \\nexploit this opportunity there is a need to design appropriate platforms able to \\nmanage and process data deriving from sensors thanks to the recent technological \\ndevelopments it has become possible to integrate physical networks of sos with \\ncognitive systems where applications can use such an intelligent infrastructure to \\ncarry out data analytics process optimization and decision support in particular we \\npropose to deal with the traditional physical security issue of bbs under a cpss \\nperspective the technological infrastructure of a bb can be modelled as a cpss \\nwhere smart and nonsos used as protection measures can interact among them and \\nwith humans through a digital network moreover the introduction of an effective and \\ntailored intelligent protection system is responsible to manage an analyze data \\nacquired to synthetic sensors \\nthe ips we proposed combines a high level of security and safety within a bank \\nbranch to a more rapid access to the physical structure and an increased positive \\n\\nbank branches as smart environments     \\nfeeling requested by the customers the noninvasive sensor network designed within \\nthe platform realizes a more comfortable environment through the elimination from \\nthe customers sight of protective elements of a crime such as bars revolving doors \\ngunmen etc which although currently necessary to prevent robberies increase the \\nsense of anxiety this is in line with the changing of commercial banking needs \\nwhose marketing functions are pushing to let bank branches be more and more similar

\\nintroduction  \\nwe shouldnt see the future as black on the other hand our daughters may be \\nthousands of miles away from us  and our partners either dead or on a cruise ship in \\nthe caribbean so we are home alone  but in contrast to the now rather old movie \\nhero that was  years old we are  luckily we are not totally alone as we have a \\nrobot that lives with us the robot follows our routine and for some few days now is \\nspotting that \\n \\nwe are missing meals \\n \\nwe are not taking any calls \\n \\nwe are not leaving home \\n \\nwe skip exercises and avoid taking our medication \\nis it depression is it loneliness is there something that the robot should do to \\nhelp in the european horizons mario project wwwmarioprojecteu we \\nhave been building apps that would help the robot entertain persons with dementia \\nbut we havent thought about reaching a higher level namely of equipping the robot \\nwith the necessary consciousness model that will help it become a selfstarter in many \\neveryday situations that a human might operate well there is surprisingly much \\nresearch work and bibliography in the area of collaborative systems some of which \\nalso relevant to elderly care that can be of direct value and use in the area of human \\nrobot interaction in this paper we aim to make clear the need for synergies between \\nthe two areas \\n\\n a koumpis et al \\nby january  our european research project mario wwwmarioprojecteu \\ncame to its end in mario we introduced a humanoid care robot to help and facilitate \\ninteractions with persons with dementia  an all in all difficult target group  \\nhowever and going one level deeper in the project and its research agenda we were \\naddressing the difficult challenges of loneliness and isolation in older persons with \\ndementia through innovative and multifaceted inventions delivered by service robots \\nthe effects of these conditions are severe and lifelimiting they burden individuals \\nand societal support systems human intervention is costly but the severity can be \\nprevented or mitigated by simple changes in selfperception and brain stimulation \\nmediated by robots in  is stated that until the present loneliness is being treated \\nas a symptom of mental health problems however for elderly aged  years and \\nabove loneliness has become a disease in itself there are epidemiological \\nphenomenological and etiological reasons to say that \\nwhat we have identified during the project lifetime and both as result of our \\nresearch activities but also as result of our interactions with patients their relatives \\nand the carers is that there is well identifiable space which may have been treated as a \\nblindspot as of today and which concerns the area of modelling of human \\nconsciousness mechanisms to govern the robot human consciousness in our context \\nrefers both to the robot that may need to build some primitive consciousness to \\nsupport its interactions with the humans in the form of empathy or affection but also \\nfrom the side of the human user so that in case of loss of abilities due to dementia or \\nsome other reason they will be assisted for a variety of functions and tasks \\nthis means that while in mario project we mainly cared about offering \\ninterventions there is need for some new research that will analyse human \\nconsciousness mechanisms identify their main features and identify the border \\nbetween human consciousness and unconsciousness to support reasoning learning \\nand adaptation to varying emotional and behavioural patterns conditions and \\npreferences  \\nthe main outcome of such a research would be a software model of a robot \\nassistant that might offer functionality and features of a virtual coach with an in\\nbuilt evolution capability at a first level such a capability should be based on routine \\ntasks and some initial relevant physiological and behavioural data over time it should \\nbecome more specialised to reflect the particular needs and preferences of each \\nindividual older person \\nin  the authors pose a rhetoric question asking whether it is possible to devise \\na general architectural principle that might lead an artificial agent to exploit what is \\ncalled consciousness in human beings and various animals stating also that in a \\nscientific and technological context whatever formulation of consciousness one opts \\nto consider consciousness should not come at the end of the day as an addition to an \\notherwise working description of a physical system for such a working description \\nof a physical system it is that the authors of  recognize that one has to look into \\nthe construction of agentoriented design processes and more specifically what the \\nauthors call the definition of the best way to create adhoc agent oriented design \\nprocesses in this respect the development of consciousness as a multi agent system \\nwould following the authors argumentation line require great efforts in learning \\nand using an existing design process and the main idea of the approach taken is one \\nhas to include in the design process also the system metamodel \\n\\nthe robot who loved me \\n \\nin  the author reports about the advances made in the it industry in the area of \\nmachine reading to avoid the term distant reading introduced by moretti in  and \\nwhich has been in the last years mainly focused on the reading of literature and \\nwhat was considered as one of artificial intelligences holiest grails for many years \\nwhat is interesting and relevant to our context here is a remark that one of the \\ninterviewed researchers ernest davis a new york university professor of computer \\nscience and ai researcher provided namely that this  machine reading is \\ntechnically an accomplishment but its not like we have to begin worshipping our \\nrobot overlords adding what epitomizes most successfully the point we take in our \\nresearch namely that when you read a passage it doesnt come out of the clear blue \\nsky it draws on a lot of what you know about the world \\n \\nthe main idea \\nthe idea of approaching real world objects through knowledge graphs automatically \\ncreated from multimodal information sources is at least to our knowledge from the \\nliterature uncommon however what might be a more uncommon idea is the case of \\nautomatically building and populating human consciousness models with the use of \\nknowledge graphs \\nknowledge discovery from digital big multimodal data can be done effectively by \\nemploying techniques like machine learning such as deep learning sift \\ndistributional semantics in nlp eg for text mining purposes and semantic \\naugmentation use of domain specific formal ontologies  \\nhowever and in order to facilitate the modeling of human consciousness such an \\napproach can be seen as a process where studying the actual artefact ie the human \\nconsciousness is replaced by studying a latent virtual object consisting of a dense \\nnetwork of related information this latent object is produced from secondary \\nsources namely digital or digitised images and texts or other modalities where the \\nimage or the text is used as an interface to the latent object to which the human user \\nhas no access to  \\nwe see a similarity with the case of an art historian studying artefacts from images \\nand catalogues or essays or a medical doctor trying to identify pathogenies from \\nmedical images and test data in both cases the form of information can be \\n \\nstructured data eg data from a collections management system records or \\nmedical test results  \\n \\nunstructured text eg free text description of an artefact \\n \\nimages eg digital or digitized images of museum objects or cat scans  \\n \\nformalized domain knowledge existing in bibliography and in the experience \\nof the person examining the material  \\nthese sources constitute already a limiting approach to the true nature of the object \\nas such since they constitute already processed knowledge thus eliminating facets \\nof it eg same as d images provide us with information about the form of an object \\nfrom a certain perspective only textual descriptions offer information only deemed \\nimportant by the author of the document etc  \\n\\n a koumpis et al \\nmoreover the application of algorithms in these already secondary sources are \\nperceived as black boxes thus giving the domain experts no transparent results to \\nconstruct an argumentation supporting their research \\n \\nthe need for a collaborative systems perspective  \\nthere is a qualitative difference between the term need and this of a necessity though \\nboth words are pretty close denoting some similar condition the difference between \\nthem lies on the prioritization as while for a need there is an absolute demand the \\nnecessity also relates to a craving without which a person manages to survive \\nour main position in this position paper is that there is a well identifiable space for \\nresearch to take place in the following years that will aim to support the field of \\nhumanrobot interaction and in particular the area of contentcreation with research \\nthat will be at a first level informed and at a further level building on the work of \\ncollaborative systems work conducted and reported in  and  is of direct \\nrelevance in a variety of ways as we shall be able to indicate below where we see a \\ngreat potential in the collaboration and the synergies for future research with the help \\nof the prove community \\nin  the authors state that in order to have a robotic system able to effectively \\nlearn by imitation and not merely reproduce the movements of a human teacher the \\nsystem should have the capabilities of deeply understanding the perceived actions to \\nbe imitated in our context we need to combine all existing knowledge patterns and \\ninformation sources that may be considered as relevant to a situation that our mario \\nrobot may encounter while also relate them or if more appropriately match them \\nwith a situation that the robot may have just or recently encountered with a human \\nuser like this of holding a conversation on a family matter planning for the visit of a \\nrelative or need to have some medical tests to this aim we take a holistic approach \\nthat combines bottomup and topdown approach in particular \\n \\nbottomup approach that is based on the employment of big data analytics \\ntechniques to explore what may in the future constitute some potentially relevant \\npatterns by having access to a vast pool of online media resources like social \\nmedia internet discussion forums blogs etc that are relevant to the discussion \\ntopic between the human and the robot as well as a \\n \\ntopdown approach that takes as starting points existing patterns or instances of \\npast interactions between the robot and the human in the recent past and check \\nfor their relevance \\nas one may expect the superiority and the longer term sustainability and value of \\nour approach relates to the combination of both bottomup and topdown approaches \\nonly the topdown would result into yet another spellchecker only the bottomup \\nwould result into an endless crawling of the web where patterns might be ignored \\neven if they would exist because they couldnt be identified using the current \\ninformation same as in crime forensics where dna profiling may have been used \\nafter several years to identify individuals by characteristics of their dna our tools \\nshall offer the capability to store patterns that will be identified after some time when \\nsome increased information will have been collected this is an important feature of \\nour approach \\n\\nthe robot who loved me \\n \\nfurther to this complementary and potentially relevant patterns will be identified \\nby means of algorithms in statistical analysis and machine learning for sentiment \\nextraction and social network analysis bottomupapproach in particular this \\napproach has the potential to uncover hitherto unknown patterns in the source data \\nand therefore enable the construction of new hate speech categories related to a \\nspecific field and knowledge base the outcomes of both approaches will be united in \\na consistent unified formal knowledge representation to allow both for an extended \\nand improved understanding of the subjects of investigation and for a longterm \\nversatile reusability of the collected data at our group we have developed datadriven \\nmethods for datadriven decision making recommendation and contextual suggestion \\nengines using andor developing algorithms for classification clustering rule \\nextraction and sentiment analysis \\nto the above one may find an instance of the problem of origins and first cause or \\nwhat we usually call as a chicken and egg situation we have been all educated to use \\nin relational data and database modeling as this has been typically the prevailing \\nparadigm that was also driven by the structure of available data for many years now \\nthe key question that has been driving the development the research and the business \\nthere and is also used as the main design theme is what answers do i have \\nhowever todays problems and challenges as well as modern data and database \\nmodeling what is also usually called as nosql is typically driven by application\\nspecific access patterns ie the types of queries to be supported so the main question \\nand also the main design theme here is what questions do i have \\nit is for this reason that collaborative systems are relevant and highly necessary to \\nconsider as an enabling technology for all future developments in the areas of \\nintelligent systems and in particular for the area of human robot interaction  \\none should be able to intuitively see the difference and also the parallels we see \\nwith the modelling of human consciousness as an example we can imagine a library \\nwith all sorts of books  the books that a person may have read in their lives we are \\nall aware of the dewey system  or as it is properly called the dewey decimal \\nclassification this is an ideal role model example on why people came up with the \\nconcept and the idea of relational databases and by the way this is a system that \\nstarted being shaped back in the s \\nhowever if one imagines that our driver is not to find \\n \\nif a book exists in our library or  \\n \\nwho has borrowed it  \\n \\nwho is the publisher  \\n \\nwhen it was published or  \\n \\nother similar relational questions  \\nbut \\n \\nanything about the contents of the books  \\n \\nanything that might be unexpected unplannable impossible or even at some \\npoint to consider as unworthy to even model when building our neat and \\ncute relational database reality  \\nit is in this case where we dont know which possible questions we have where the \\nneed for adopting a collaborative systems approach comes on stage  \\n\\n a koumpis et al \\nthere is always a risk with the quality of the information acquired from unknown \\nsources  a good example for this relates with the case of fake news if the \\nconsciousness model for our case relies on any type of lesser value content such as the \\ncase of fake news it is obvious that this will affect the quality of the model as such \\nto this problem however we can take a similar stand to the one we take in real life \\nnot all people build their consciousness on the same sources or may be able to exhibit \\nsome evidencebased consistency in the way their consciousness models are built but \\nit is therefore that a cnbased approach would increase the value of the end system \\nas the aggregate results of such a consciousness model that comes as outcome of the \\ncollaboration amongst can will tend to be more accurate than any single entity alone \\nthis collaboration aspect should be not mistakenly related to with crowdsourcing that \\nis rather the process where knowledge is obtained from the public at large through a \\nsystem of invitations and incentives   \\n \\na word on ethics \\nthe ethics work during the mario project provided an innovative integrated \\napproach to addressing ethical issues in robot design research and implementation \\naddressing the entire development process of the project  as developed within \\nthe project lifetime the ethics framework we developed provided a new \\ncomprehensive review of relevant interdisciplinary literature with relevance for \\nunderstanding ethical concerns regarding the use of care robots a useful contribution \\nto the field of the ethics of care robots in addition its findings informed the approach \\nto data management in the project  \\non the basis of the mario ethics framework a set of innovative practical tools in \\nthe form of five ethics checklists were developed to guide ethical practice for different \\nstakeholders in robot development research and implementation these were tested \\nby different stakeholders who found them to be helpful practical tools for their \\nrespective practice areas an ethical encountered issues form was employed during \\nthe pilots to capture evidence on the incidence of actual ethical issues that \\nstakeholders encountered during trials these indicated that careful implementation \\nwas required but that users generally tolerated the robot well and distress was rare \\nthese tools have the potential to be employed in different care robot projects and \\nthe ethics tools and experiences from the project will be published to make them \\navailable to the international robot community contributing to the development of a \\nsolid evidence base of ethical concerns in care robotics which if those results remain \\nas positive as during the mario project is likely to facilitate wider societal \\nacceptance of the use of care robots in the care setting it is interesting in this context \\nto take into account that in  the authors identify in relation to service robots a \\nproblem related amongst others with loss of control from the side of the elderly \\nperson due to robot monitoring and the interventions that the latter undertake within \\ntheir daily activities and routine this is true at a great extent and same as the feeling \\nof a loss of privacy and the feeling of infantilisation however one has to admit \\nthat the benefits of such a technology equal out at a great extent all potential \\ndrawbacks \\n\\nthe robot who loved me \\n \\n \\nconclusions \\ndevelopments in the addressed area of modeling human consciousness in computable \\nand computerprocessable forms are still in a fluid form this poses a challenge for \\nbringing together a corpus of research that has taken and is still taking place in the \\narea of collaborative systems to identify and if possible also seize challenges that \\nwill change the way we perceive our idea for the use of robots in everyday tasks the \\nresult of a robot intelligence will not anymore rely on its hardwired intelligence but \\nwith use of sentiment analysis and deep learning technologies their capabilities to \\nextract information from a variety of modalities and media including videos images \\nnatural language as well as structured data and then automatically transform them \\ninto actionable information by means of deploying them in their interactions with \\nthe human users  \\nit is worth to mention here that in the mario project as well as in the context of \\nthe present paper we refer to robots that act as an extension of humans offering to \\nthem a symbiotic perspective so these are not what one would consider as truly \\nautonomous robots however the aim to model aspects of the human consciousness \\nis dual namely on the one hand to replicate it in robots while on the other hand to \\nhelp robots extend and complement the consciousness of people with decaying \\ncognitive ability \\nfrom our research expertise it is evident that we promote the idea of exploiting \\ndevelopments in the areas of semantic technologies and statistical based natural \\nlanguage processing to facilitate the task of building datadriven models of body \\nconsciousness that will be possible to be easily populated with big data acquired from \\na variety of sources furthermore we are able to see that the improvements to be \\nmade will seriously lag behind the needs that exist if our research shall not be \\ninformed and enriched with the perspective taken in the area of collaborative systems \\nhuman intelligence is in all its aspects and manifestations such a system \\nconsisting of a variety of entities and artifacts demonstrating also characteristics of \\nautonomy as well as synergy geography is also of importance with the ability to take \\nadvantage of geographical distribution as well as of geographical concentration while \\nlast but not least heterogeneity is also a key term as it affects all levels like the \\nculture the socioeconomic context or even the daily operational routines \\nit may seem like a novelty to think of a future with networks of collaborating \\nrobots that are working together to offer a service to an individual however and \\nwhile from a technology stance this may be a novelty from an organizational point \\nthis is not at all currently and for the care to an old person there may be their \\nchildren that will interact with the physicians and the nurses in the future all these \\ninteractions may take place in an automated fashion by robots that will live with us \\nsame as the mario robot does with the persons with dementia \\nacknowledgements \\nthis work was supported in

the general context of this paper is the strategic planning of \\ndistribution centre warehouses the idea is to anticipate changes in the \\nwarehouse based on objectives and issues generally linked to market eg \\nelectronic trade etc and environmental developments eg lastmile logistics \\netc planning requires overcoming the consequences of the choices made as \\nwell as their interactions to inform and justify projected technological choices \\nit is crucial to identify and understand design rules which are often \\ncontradictory problems arise out of contradictions to support strategic \\nplanning the decisionmaking aid proposed in this paper consists of extracting \\nand formalising all problems in the form of contradictory design rules  \\nkeywords warehousing systems strategic planning technology forecasting \\nevolution of warehousing cartography of contradictions \\n   introduction \\nto a large extent the logistics costs of warehouses are determined during the design \\nphase  as a general rule based on a functional description the warehouse design \\nphase consists of choosing a layout and associated technologies of the four core \\nactivities receiving storage order picking and shipping as well as a planning mode \\nfor the operations related to these activities   changes in this functional \\ndescription are primarily correlated with the rapidly evolving market  the \\nemergence of new consumption patterns such as ecommerce for example is likely to \\nimpose the introduction of new dedicated storage technologies involving substantial \\ninvestment and high financial risks to boot  \\nas a result it is imperative to plan and control the strategic evolution of logistic \\nwarehouses strategic planning decisions generally characterised by a  to  year \\ntimeframe relate to the determination of the general policies and plans for the use of \\nthe resources of the future warehouse  \\nin some cases these evolutions can be promptly addressed via planned decisions \\nthe activities associated with the decision are execution activities  conversely \\nwhen there are no decisions relating to the new situation a problem solving activity is \\nrequired these unscheduled decisions are more difficult to examine as they involve a \\n\\n \\nd kucharavy et al \\n \\nwideranging body of knowledge endogenous and exogenous to the warehouse this \\nbody of knowledge is often contradictory \\nresearch projects undertaken in warehousing design primarily focus on \\nendogenous warehousing parameters   few projects simultaneously factor in \\nendogenous and exogenous parameters the warehouse of the future depends on \\nenvironmental developments market demands limitations and trends bring about \\noperational technological and organisational innovations and changes  this \\ncontext raises two research questions first question what are the key characteristics \\nfor strategic decisionmaking in terms of warehousing design second question how \\nto define a systematic method for identifying key warehousing design parameters  \\nthis paper proposes a contribution to the first question only the expected \\ncontribution is the formalisation of a number of generic design rules meanseffect \\nusing an adapted language  the expected nature of design rules is contradiction \\nthe paper is structured as follows chapter  presents the theoretical framework \\nchapter  presents the methodological framework to identify and extract generic \\ndesign rules chapter  presents an industrial application by a pl logistics provider \\nfinally chapter  concludes this paper and outlines research prospects \\n   literature review  theoretical framework \\na warehouse can be represented as a storage tank  it has a buffer function in light \\nof the variability and uncertainty inherent in the supply chain its life cycle includes \\nthree major stages design and construction operation development and \\nreorganisation decommissioning or reprocessing to consider conceptual design on a \\n to  year timeframe in terms of organisational architecture and processes a reliable \\nvision of the demands limitations and trends of the future warehouse is needed  \\nthe strategic decision relating to warehouse evolution must take account of the \\ndynamic changes of the activities and functions as well as the specific characteristics \\nof the systems life cycle  \\nstrategic decisionmaking in warehousing design is linked to the following generic \\nquestions  \\n \\nwhat are the achievable and unachievable performance levels  \\n \\nis it necessary to modify the condition of the existing system  \\n \\nwhat is the effect of decision criteria on the new situation \\n \\nwhat are the most significant decision criteria in terms of system \\nperformance \\n \\nwhen decision criteria cannot be modified simultaneously in what \\nchronological order should these criteria be modified \\n \\netc \\nthe traditional approach in the design phase consists of inventing creating \\npossible alternatives from which to choose the rational decisionmaking model  \\n is a step process   define the problem  identify decision criteria  \\nweight the criteria  develop alternatives  assess alternatives rule if criterion \\nthen alternative  choose the best alternative this model is a sequential and \\nlogical structuring of the information to be analysed   the multicriteria \\n\\ncollaborative design of warehousing  using the concept of contradictions \\n \\napproaches generally undertaken  help select the best solution or the optimal \\nsolution from a broad range of solutions the yesno type alternative being one \\nparticular case as part of a more general case when alternatives are incompatible \\nwith the decision criteria values a position must be taken in relation to these \\ncontradictions \\nthis paper hypothesises that the problem solving process during the design phase \\ninvolves the identification of one or more contradictions resulting from the new \\ndecision context eg market developments consequently contradictions are the \\nexpression of a problem by consequences of the choices made but obviously at least \\ntwo opposing consequences are required for a problem to arise by expressing the \\ncauseandeffect relationships between means and performance the contradiction \\nidentification process reveals the rules used this helps clarify conflict areas but also \\nand most importantly the reasons for projected technological choices \\nto advance the decisionmaking process towards a choice of technological \\nsolution literature proposes several technological forecasting methods initial \\nsignificant research dates back to the early th century    the primary \\npurpose of these methods is to provide a consensual view of the future technological \\nsituation  a review of scientific journals institutional reports and publications \\n   highlights methodological advances in terms of technological \\nforecasting for socioeconomic and technological levels rather than for the techno\\nlogical level itself the major improvements identified by the methods used to \\nforecast technological changes relate to a combination of existing techniques and \\nmodels and the refinement of existing methods   the exponential increase \\nin the number of publications institutions and researchers involved in forecasting and \\nthe development of technological forecasting methods in the past five decades has \\nyielded a multitude of techniques and methodologies  \\nafter reviewing the current practice of longterm technological forecasting \\nmethods these methods can be classified into four categories   \\n \\nphenomenological models for example time series data extrapolations \\nregressions  \\n \\nintuitive models for example the delphi method structured and unstructured \\ninterviews  \\n \\nmonitoring and mapping for example by reviewing the literature and sources \\npublished scenarios mapping of existing information \\n \\nand finally the causal models used in this paper to analyse warehousing \\nsystem evolution rules  \\nthe next chapter describes the method based on causal models \\n   research methodology \\nthe researchintervention method selected relies on the researching future method
